	He was holding a heavy metal flashlight in his right hand. I figured that 
	must have been what he hit me with. I was suprised, but lucky, that he 
	didn't knock me unconscience with his swing. Though I was dazed from the 
	strike on the head, I was impressed by my ability to wipe him out with one 
	blow.
	I stood up, still blurred, and made sure the Band-Aid box was still in my 
	pocket. I quickly concluded that I was scared, injured and needed the 
	assistance of a man. (Obviously the first who came to my mind was Josh, but 
	he was not an option at this particular moment.)</span></p>

	I ran to Thomas' room as fast as I could and banged on the door. He opened 
	it wearing nothing but his black jockey boxers. I was too afraid to wait in 
	the hall until he got dressed, so I pushed myself by him and ran in. I 
	closed and locked the door behind me, while he was reaching for the light 
	switch. <i>&quot;What's going on?...Rebecca......what's wrong?&quot;</i> he asked me. He put his 
	hands gently above my shoulder, one just past my neck, and the other close 
	to my chin, so the he could look me in the eyes. When he pulled his hand 
	from my neck, to sweep the hair out of my eyes, his hand was covered in 
	blood. His eyes grew in size and he demanded to know what happened and who 
	did this to me.
	Tears were streaming down my cheeks and I started stuttering when I tried to 
	speak. (Fear had a way of taking over me like that.) I was so upset that 
	nothing I said seemed to make any sense. I was talking too quickly and 
	jumbling my words together. I calmed down a bit then, finally, was able to 
	tell him everything that happened at the Staybridge and what happened just 
	minutes ago.</span></p>

	<i>&quot;What if I was asleep in there, Thomas?&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;Who knows what he could 
	have...or would have done!&quot;</i><br>
	Thomas sat me in the desk chair and said. <i>&quot;I want you to stay here...I'm 
	about to go down there and kick some ass.&quot; </i>He told me to lock the door 
	behind him when he left, and not to open it for anyone.
	He quickly dressed in dark blue jeans and a white thermal shirt. He slid on 
	his sneakers and went running out of the room. I locked the door and went 
	into his bathroom the wipe some of the blood from the back of my head. My 
	wet towel tactic wasn't working too well, but the cool water on the back of 
	my throbbing head felt wonderful!<br>
	I went back out into his room and sat on the bed. I stared into 
	subconscience, not really thinking of anything in particular, when a knock 
	on the door slapped me back into reality. My eyes widened and my stomach 
	turned inside out.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	I got up and ran to the door. I listened for a minute but whoever was there 
	made no sound. I did a quick survey of Thomas' room in search of something I 
	could use as a weapon. I saw some dumbbells at the foot of the bed and 
	hurried to retrieve one. I trudged the heavy weight with me back to the door 
	and said in a demanding tone, <i>&quot;Who is it?&quot;</i>
	There was no answer, just a laugh. I knew it was Andrews. <i>&quot;What do you want? 
	Just go away!&quot; </i>I screamed out to him. I was hoping my voice would wake 
	Thomas' next door room neighbors, but then considered his loud music. They 
	either had to be deaf or were non-exhistant, two qualities that gave me no 
	advantage.
	The hall was quiet. I turned off the light and bent down to see if I could 
	see a shadow under the door frame. I wanted to burst into tears when I 
	realized that there was not a shadow of a man. There was the shadow of two 
	men.</span></p>
