    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Every time I see Dr. 
    Tachikawa, my gaze lingers a bit too eagerly. People are starting to notice. 
    If I’m not careful I myself will become the subject of all the gossip. Do 
    they know that we went out to diner? Dr. Tachikawa seems indifferent. He 
    even seems to ignoring me. When I think back to how I was messing about with 
    that salad, I’m ashamed. Why did I have to drink so much again? And why do I 
    display such weird behavior when I’m drunk? No wonder he acts as if nothing 
    happened last night. OK, we didn’t have sex or anything. But we did have a 
    nice evening, didn’t we? I wouldn’t have minded if we would have had sex. 
    It’s been such a long time. Almost two months now, the last few weeks when 
    we were together Stig and I hardly even looked at each other. I wonder if he 
    misses me. I’m happy to say I don’t miss him. He was way too temperamental 
    for me. One moment a sturdy Viking and the next a crybaby. I just couldn’t 
    deal with the instability. A more well-balanced person would complement my 
    character better. Someone like Dr. Tachikawa for instance, with his optimism 
    and charm. His choice of clothing, his deliberate, disciplined posture seem 
    to suggest experience and wisdom. A man with a good upbringing. His humor is 
    almost sadistic and his glance suggests the same while his childish 
    chuckling and small physique are disarming. I just have to watch him when 
    he’s around. I must try to figure out his personality. </span></p>
