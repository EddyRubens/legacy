    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">OK, I have to admit I 
    was in a bit of a shocked state. The thing Dr. Hamilton wanted to show me 
    was a diamond studded tennis bracelet. He said he bought it for me because 
    I, <i>&quot;...was such a good sport for doing all of this.&quot;</i> I know for a 
    fact, that I am not the only 'good sport' here. And, I also know for a fact, 
    that diamond studded tennis bracelets were not handed out to all of the 
    other 'good sports!' </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I figured that it was 
    time I drew the line without being too harsh. I didn't want to embarrass the 
    poor old guy. <i>&quot;Dr. Hamilton I am both flattered and shocked that you 
    think of me that way. But, you must remember that I have a boyfriend that I 
    am very devoted to.&quot; &quot;I...I Uh, I never intended...&quot; </i>he interrupted. I 
    interrupted him right back and said, <i>&quot;You are a very nice man. Just not 
    the one for me. But, I do know for a fact that Sheila has somewhat of a 
    crush on you. She mentioned it once to me. Maybe you should try to pursue 
    that route.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;I had no idea! Sheila is very hard 
    working and loyal to our company. She always told me no matter what happens, 
    she'll stand by my side.&quot; &quot;See,&quot;</i> I continued. <i>&quot;That how women sent 
    messages, through discrete comments!&quot;</i> Dr. Hamilton smiled and apologized 
    for his actions. He said he hoped that this wouldn't change the work 
    relationship we had or the friendship we made. I assured him that I was 
    flattered and happy to remain just friends. Then I left his office.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">On the way back to my 
    room I saw Sheila in the hall. She was reading over a file. I figured, since 
    I baited Dr. Hamilton, I should prepare her to be hooked. <i>&quot;Hi Sheila!&quot;</i> 
    I said as I approached her. She looked at me with a half smiled and squinted 
    as she said, <i>&quot;You sure seem to have had your spirits lifted. Is there 
    anything you would like to talk about?&quot; &quot;Why yes there is, Sheila.&quot; </i>I 
    said smiling. Sheila smiled and said <i>&quot;We should go into my office.&quot;</i> I 
    shook my head 'No' and said, <i>&quot;I will tell you here, then I must get going.&quot; 
    &quot;Okay...&quot;</i>she said. <i>&quot;I just came back from Dr. Hamilton's office...&quot;</i> 
    I said in a whisper. <i>&quot;He just told me that he thinks you are cute and he 
    has a bit of a crush on you!&quot; </i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Sheila's face turn red 
    and she told me to stop fooling around. I swore her to secrecy. I told her, 
    as my therapist, she was bound by law not to share anything I tell her. She 
    smiled at me. This was the first time I think, I can remember her being 
    truly happy. I think I am doing a good thing. I will head back </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">to my room now. Such a 
    busy day!</span></p>
