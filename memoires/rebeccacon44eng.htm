    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I am not sure if it's 
    refreshing or scary when I see new faces around here. On my way out to the 
    Japanese Gardens, I saw Dr. Hamilton talking to a strange man. I say strange 
    because I have never seen him around here before. But, I got the feeling 
    that I knew him from somewhere. When I noticed Dr. Hamilton gaze up at me, I 
    got so nervous that I quickly put it past me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was just grateful 
    that Dr. Hamilton was momentarily preoccupied. I didn't want him to stop me 
    and want to talk. Especially after last night. He obviously knew what was 
    going to happen. But what was worst was...he let it happen. I quickly walked 
    past the two of them and headed for the front door. I saw Rosanne walking to 
    toward them as I took a look back. She shook the strangers hand and said she 
    was <i>&quot;pleased that he made efforts to come and visit.&quot;</i> Dr. Hamilton called 
    out my name as Rosanne was talking to the stranger. I kept walking and 
    pretended not to hear him. I know this must have angered him. I'll try to 
    shed a tear for him later.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I got to the 
    Japanese Gardens, I headed straight for the Bonsai Tree. Megan was not there. 
    I was afraid that someone might have found out about our plan and kept her 
    locked up in the facility somewhere. As I was waiting, I couldn't help but 
    think about the stranger at Braintec. Where had I seen him before? Then I 
    remembered. He was the man sitting in front of me on the plane, when I was 
    returning from my trip in Germany. How could I have forgotten? He was the 
    one talking to Rosanne and asking the millions of questions. He must have 
    decided to try it out for himself. I wondered if I should let him know what 
    he was getting in to. But then again, I can't help but want to blame him for 
    my being here. It was the conversation he had with Rosanne that lit my 
    curiosity fuse.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Megan arrived about 20 
    minutes after I got there. She kept saying how sorry she was for being late. 
    She said she forgot the directions and made a wrong turn somewhere along the 
    way and got lost. I told her there was nothing to apologize for. I was just 
    glad she was able to make it. She told me that the doctors, especially Dr. 
    Tachikawa, yell at her when she forgets things. I assured her that I was 
    nothing like them and have made plenty of mistakes myself. Once I was able 
    to calm her down, we sat and talked. I told her my stories </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">and experiences here, 
    then she shared hers.</span></p>
