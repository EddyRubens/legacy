 Arial"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Center I saw a boy and a girl on 
    a bench, kissing each other passionately. I never liked stickiness in public 
    and usually I pretend not to see it. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Today I couldn’t look away.
    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">The French kiss kept burning my 
    retina; I had not enough power to stop it. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">I wished I was one of those 
    teenagers. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">This thought surprised me. 
    How could I wish to take part in something I dislike seeing? </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Something that irritates me so 
    much? But it was true. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I would love 
    to become the boy or the girl who were lapping up the kisses. For today I 
    would like to have a good kiss in the middle of the Van Woustreet, please, 
    where everyone can see me. It happened to me in bygone days. After a school 
    party, at the swimming pool or just somewhere in the City</span><span style="font-family:
 Arial"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Center like these teenagers. I 
    never cared about the frowning faces of bystanders. Even if my buddies’ 
    hands moved under my T-shirt, I didn’t mind the presence of pedestrians.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-weight:700">Since I work as a test 
    subject for Braintec, several trifles made me think about the past. Even 
    after the sessions I constantly think about my memories. How were things in 
    the good old days and do I wish to experience them again? Sometimes this 
    center becomes a sort of psychiatric hospital where I’m supposed to rethink 
    my life through therapeutic self analyses. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Do I wish to be young 
    again? No, that’s bullshit. Though, even if you’ve passed the age of forty 
    you can still be a passionate kisser lacking good manners. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Or if you’ve passed fifty or 
    sixty. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I can imagine myself kissing 
    as if my life depends on it when I’m over eighty. Or is it the daily job 
    that resists me? Maybe I haven’t got the right character for a job with 
    people above me. I want to rebel. Most probably it’s just the tension, the 
    rashness that I desire. Not the French kiss. </span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">&nbsp;</span></p>
