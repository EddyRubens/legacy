    strange mail. This time Dr. Hamilton’s. He truly apologized for his behavior 
    the other day and begged me to return to Portland. He has to get to the 
    bottom of just what he has been up to and blamed himself. He desperately 
    wants me to come back. Why actually? Am I that indispensable?</b> </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">And he was talking 
    about my contribution to his K.M.A. project. Some weeks beforehand I had 
    given him the names of a few important officers who in the past had been in 
    the Dutch news involving a mysterious case. They put out a feeler 
    about something there. With their help Braintec has opened an office in 
    Holland, on military grounds. In return Braintec registers the good memories 
    of soldiers in training, presuming that they might need it when these 
    soldiers suffer from war-trauma during their future career. So they finally 
    learned to deal with the Post Gulf War Syndrome. I find it very strange. 
    Conserving your good memories just in case they are misled by misery. It 
    looks like a sperm-bank to me. I do not want to deal with it, all that 
    military stuff. Luckily I don’t have to anymore. </span></p>

    want to return to Portland? I love receiving mail from people over there. I 
    want to keep up the news about the whole affair and still feel very involved 
    in it. But returning? For the time being, no. Between Kodjiro and me, it 
    doesn’t run smooth, but I wouldn’t like to miss him already. And, moreover, 
    I’m just as happy that I don’t have to wear that stupid costume. Oh no, I’m 
    staying here for the time being. I didn’t know how to explain it to Dr. 
    Hamilton. Therefore I didn’t reply his mail, out of pure indolence. </span>
