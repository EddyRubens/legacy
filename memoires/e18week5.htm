    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>There was an article 
    on Dr. Tachikawa and his invention in today’s newspaper. Actually a decent 
    article attached to a beautiful photo. <i>“Plug and Replay your memories – 
    Total Recall finally reality.”</i> Good article. Written in a populistic way 
    but still worthwhile reading. Dr. Tachikawa&nbsp; should be a satisfied man.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It is thrilling 
    getting involved in something like this here. It is happening right here and 
    right now. The inventions which are tested here will be world-wide news soon. 
    Maybe in future every family has their own recall-kit at home. Doesn’t 
    Johnny-boy understand what mamma is saying? Wait, then we will share my 
    experience! Never talk about <i>“when you grow up you will understand what 
    is good for you”.</i> New educational methods, new techniques for meetings, 
    new politics but most of all, new forms of entertainment. <i>“Have you tried 
    the latest rodeo-experiment of Cowboy Jacky already? If you watch that ring 
    on his right hand closely enough, you get even further!”</i> No need 
    traveling to New Zealand to enjoy the best bungee-jump.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">I wonder what it shall 
    mean to me whenever this castle in the air will win from the future. Will I 
    be known as “first lady with a MESI” better than being registered in the 
    Guinness Book of Records? Will my memories be for sale in shops in the near 
    future? By that time movie-actors will not be famous anymore for their 
    outlook and acting talents but known for their rich world of imagination. 
    Who knows I shall win an Oscar for the most spectacular, however, honorable 
    memory! My UFO-experience would be well recommended. I have not talked about 
    it to anyone because of this panic. What a shame. I’m really curious to know 
    how others have gone through that experience. Time will tell when this 
    hectic period is over and done with. Unless that memory is already out of 
    date ‘coss it is situated on an M-Store A type....</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In the afternoon 
    yesterday’s presentation was heard on the radio. Together with a bunch of 
    youngsters we were gathered in the lounge. They invited a specialist who 
    thought the whole idea as ethical irresponsible. A few test subjects 
    expressed themselves by calling <i>“Boo-boo!”</i> Tonight’s guest in the TV 
    talk-show is Dr. Tachikawa. Never a dull moment. </span></p>
