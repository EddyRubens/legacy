    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Nothing worth mentioning happens the 
    days after that. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t fun. On the contrary; Heather 
    and I had a wonderful time. We visited some tourist attractions inside Tokyo 
    and short trips to the countryside. Spring in Japan is marvelous. There’s 
    even more in bloom than in Holland. At the countryside, tradition and modern 
    civilization go hand in hand often. Just beside a mechanized arable farm is 
    an old monastery.&nbsp; After giving a donation they would predict our future. We 
    both got some kind of cylinder with dozens of sticks in it. We had to shake 
    it that hard that one stick fell out. That stick made our prophecy. Heather 
    could handle it quit soon. <i>“You will marry within a short period of time”</i>, 
    was her prophecy. <i>“That definitely not what I had planned”</i> Heather 
    responded. Then it was my turn. It wasn’t easy. Either all sticks went back 
    inside the cylinder or several sticks came out at the same time. At the end 
    I could manage. <i>“You will conquer all your difficulties soon”</i> the 
    stick said. Should Braintec bring us even more problems? </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">We went to the theater or music 
    events almost every night. Both Japanese traditions and the more western 
    kinds of arts are present in Tokyo. You get used at the Japanese appearances 
    quit soon. They love to help after you greet them politely.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial">There wasn’t much to refuse. Dude to 
    their standoffish we were seldom invited to enter buildings. Nobody forced 
    to get in touch with us. We couldn’t stay for ever. My boss expected me and 
    Heather had to continue her study. We made reservations for our flight home. 
    Two days before the journey to home we finally received a message, at a 
    place where we didn’t expect it. In a small town in the countryside where we 
    were having lunch, a woman carrying a red and white Braintec file headed 
    towards us. She asked us if she could take us to a small Braintec office in 
    a small town nearby. We refused that. Heather and I have discussed before 
    what to with such a request. We came up with the idea to meat each other the 
    following day at the terrace of a teahouse near a temple in Tokyo. That is a 
    neutral spot in the presence of a lot of other people. And we know the area 
    there. The Japanese sustained after huge protest. That night we invite the 
    Japanese artist to enter our room. We bought a lot of nice food and tried to 
    make a traditional Japanese meal. The guest don’t recognize it as Japanese 
    but the like it. It is very cozy. We hear a lot about things going on inside 
    the Japanese art world.</span></p>
