    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">After I read 
    the CIA email I saw that I had another letter from Megan. I quickly read it:<br>
    <i>&quot;Rebecca, Yes, I would like to meet with you in the Japanese Gardens. I 
    feel I can trust you and would like talk. I have no friends here in America 
    and would like to have one. I am worried that Dr. Hamilton has something bad 
    planned for me. Why else would I not be allowed to speak with anyone? Please 
    let me know good a time for you.&nbsp; Megan&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I was so 
    happy to receive mail from Megan. I wrote her back and told her to meet me 
    tomorrow at 2:00. Then I gave her directions to the Bonsai Tree where Carmen 
    and I spoke. I can only hope she will show up. After I emailed Megan, I was 
    getting ready to respond to the CIA email.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Someone slid 
    a note was underneath the door. It was from Sheila it read: <i>&quot;Rebecca, Dr. 
    Hamilton would like to conduct a small experiment with you today. Please 
    come to his office at 3:00.&nbsp; Sheila&quot; </i>This letter irritated me. Why 
    couldn't she knock on the door? And why was Sheila delivering messages for 
    Dr. Hamilton. I have a feeling I can't trust her either.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I told Carmen 
    what was going on with the letter from Megan and the CIA. She was worried 
    that the CIA letter it might be a hoax sent by Dr. Tachikawa and Dr. 
    Hamilton to see if we were planning anything or to see how much we knew. I 
    promised that I would look into it before I responded. I wouldn't want to 
    get us into any trouble.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I thought 
    many times about calling Josh and Diego and having them come rescue us. But, 
    what would happen with Megan? And how would we ever have these MESI 
    transplants removed. Was there a doctor out there that could do it? Would we 
    be subjected to ridicule and unwanted media for being a willing participant.

    would we ever be expected to lead a normal life?</span></p>
