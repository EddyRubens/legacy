    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The small plane 
    flights above extensive woods. Gladly we found this airport. We could have 
    drift around for weeks. The pilot, Jack, asks us for why we’re flying with 
    him. Heather tells a complicated thin excuse. My tooth are curling, the 
    story is too transparent. I try to change the subject into more innocent 
    talk. After more than two hours flying we land nearby a huge industrial 
    city. We say goodbye to Jack</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">If we turn around one 
    more time we see that Jack went immediately to his board radio and he’s 
    calling. I think he saw us through. Is he calling to Braintec? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">So the escape isn’t 
    over yet. How do we get out of here as soon as possible. There are more than 
    enough planes here. Heather has already checked it and she says there’s only 
    one leaving soon, to Tokyo. Fortunately I can change my ticket Portland 
    through Chicago to Amsterdam for a ticket to Amsterdam with a change in 
    Tokyo. Heather buys the same ticket. The desk manager seems to find it 
    strange that we’re paying in cash but he doesn’t mind. One hour after we 
    left the small plane we sit in a huge Jumbo jet. In Porland we have to 
    change flights. Fortunately no sign of Braintec. Goodbye United States and 
    goodbye Braintec. The plane is occupied for 75%., especially Japanese. One 
    American is sitting next to us and he starts a conversation. After thirty 
    minutes talking he gets something out of his pocket. A badge with FBI on it. 
    Don’t worry, you are no suspects, he says. I am searching for Braintec. Jack 
    didn’t call to Braintec but he called the police. The FMI-fellow, named 
    Paul, is after Braintec for months already. There have been callings about 
    missing persons. And people who had been operated by Braintec have come back 
    with the weirdest reactions. They know nothing about an operation but they 
    tell hundred of things about the good old times. They do nothing more than 
    recalling what happened in history. Those people are staying in nursing 
    rooms now between the Alzheimer patients. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The FB I hasn’t 
    discovered any evidence against Braintec yet. They can deal a lot with our 
    data. We are the first to leave Braintec without having surgery. They have 
    copied the data of the laptop during the stop over in Portland. The FBI has 
    especially entered the luggage deck of the plane for that.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">It fits very well that we’re flying to 
    Tokyo. That turns out to be one of the countries where Braintec has its 
    companies. Your contact person from the Netherlands, Rosanne, is there as 
    well, he tells me. The FBI seems to have a lot of information. We catch 
    electronically data traffic, Paul says. With the data out of your laptop we 
    can find much more. It is by the way a good thing that you met me. Do you 
    think you can visit Japan so easily? You need a visa for that. The fbi has 
    made contact with the Japanese secret agency already. they shall get you a 
    visa when you arrive. In Japan Braintec is a company under heavy suspicions 
    as well. It is one of the dangerous sects as well.</span></p>
