        phrase: The upload was great again! Reason enough for a discussion 
        between Steve, Rosanne and me. Both Steve and Rosanne had have the same 
        upload already. It was about the boat tour from Mark Seward, the 
        anesthetist who is always helping with the uploads. </span></td>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He is a kind of a 
    spare hand during those sessions. During the review of an upload with dr. 
    Hamilton, he is never there. That is a good thing! He must have had a very 
    risqué life and perhaps he still has. In the beginning, the whole story was 
    boring with the over aged people on the boat. However, in the end it was 
    very exciting. One of the dancing girls jumped off the stage en reached for 
    me. She tempted me and I gave her some money. We went down, to the inside of 
    the boat and found a little cabin. In the cabin were only a bed and a very 
    big mirror. She put off her clothes and her feather shawl and wrapped the 
    thing around me. In fact, she tied me up with it. – One thing I want to put 
    straight, this is the upload, it is not my story but Steward’s – It seems 
    like it embarrasses me. However, in a way it gave me pleasure.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Both 
    Rosanne and Steve had different versions of this story. When we found out, 
    we decided to write down our views on paper, so we could clearly see the 
    differences. Rosanne had not seen the big bird and her story ended like 
    Steve’s; on the upper deck of the boat. My story ended lying satisfied in 
    bed. We found one big similarity in our memories. It was nothing more than 
    the cold remembrance of a happening. Just that. There was no such thing as 
    an emotional “feeling” that came back when we remembered the whole story, in 
    compare with other memories that we had before.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">After a lot of chit 
    and chat, we came to one conclusion. There was reason to believe something 
    was wrong with this memory. The whole story acted selective. Each one of us 
    had their own special ingredients. We where puzzled. What was the cause of 
    this selectivity? Was it Mark Steward’s strange mind, or ours that caused 
    the differences? On the other hand, there could be something wrong with the 
    equipment, maybe the whole system? We all felt betrayed in a way. It meant 
    that all the uploads where not really true. Not pure. It meant all the 
    memories where all depending on our interpretation. We concluded that here 
    was a case for a psychologist. Rosanne said: <i>“Next week Lucas will come 
    over, he is one we can trust.”</i> Maybe he can give us an explanation about 
    what we found out. I have to ask him before he gets his implant. Otherwise, 
    he may not be really objective anymore. You know how it works with the 
    uploads. They make your opinion a bit cloudy.  </span></p>

    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The uploads are very addictive. 
    I am sure about that. But, I want to be clear about one thing: the uploads 
    must be real. I will not put up with less!</span><span lang="NL" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">This 
    is the real upload-addict speaking. Next Friday I go for redeveloping and 
    self reflection. All the weekend. While reading back the whole story, I 
    realize the need. Jessica is totally out of site. This is my single-handed 
    action. Maybe there is somebody who wants to accompany me to Crater Lake 
    National Park?</span></p>
