    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    was almost drunk when I entered Elisa’s bar. Adrian was cuddling Elisa and 
    to my great surprise Elisa looked at me in a friendly way. <i>“Sorry, about 
    last time,”</i> I muttered. <i>“I will behave from now on.”</i> She nodded 
    very quickly and walked over to the other side.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We were looking for a 
    table and ordered another bottle of wine. I was just seated when Adrian 
    shoot questions on me. <i>“What do you know about Kodjiro’s activities? Do 
    you have a clear picture what is going on?”</i> In the first place I told 
    him things he already knew. About fights Kodjiro had with Dr. Hamilton, 
    about the strange situation Sally had witnessed and about a few suspicious 
    remarks coming from Steward. It was quite clear to Adrian that Steward knew 
    all about it. Although he doesn’t know the role he is playing. Adrian 
    explained that, not long ago, he had asked him why he hadn’t gone to Japan 
    together with Kodjiro. He answered that he wasn’t interested in that at all 
    and that he would be better off with Dr. Hamilton. When Adrian was 
    questioning again, Steward didn’t say a word. What a pity. I would like to 
    know what that man is trying to invent in his head. He is not to be trusted.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After that we talked 
    about Sonja. Yesterday all test subjects received her email, in which she 
    mentioned that she had been kidnapped. I was shocked when I heard her story. 
    According to her, Braintec is only part of a much larger organization called 
    MemoCorp. They say they are inventing equipment for the Pentagon and the CIA 
    which can allow us to shoot in our head a smaller version of our implants, 
    at a distance of 200 meters. This was serious matter and I had problems 
    concentrating on the conversation. I just cannot imagine that Dr. Tachikawa 
    would cooperate in such a thing. And the idea she will be murdered is like 
    going paranoia. Such things do not happen in reality, do they?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Adrian also didn’t know how to handle Sonja’s story. Since he received this 
    email he doesn’t feel comfortable anymore. Imagine if it’s true, then are we 
    also in danger? Sonja advised us to leave Braintec as soon as possible. 
    Supporting a weapon of war is the last thing Adrian wanted to do. At this 
    moment Sonja would be in Tokyo. We wonder what she is doing over there. She 
    was rather behaving mysteriously about it. Anyway, together we agreed that 
    things hadn’t turn out better since Dr. Tachikawa was gone. I asked Adrian 
    which person he would vote for, Dr. Hamilton or Dr. Tachikawa, if he was to 
    make a choice. <i>“Kodjiro,”</i> he answered without hesitation. <i>“He pays 
    more for the job and gives me more freedom. Same with you?”</i> That was the 
    easy way out. No doubt, I would vote for Kodjiro. <i>“But what if Sonja’s 
    story is true….”</i> I began. I couldn’t finish my sentence. Things were 
    turning through my head. Alcohol was working stronger. A serious discussion 
    was out of the question.</span></p>
