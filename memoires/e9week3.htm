    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Out of all the people 
    it turned out to be Steward who would recall my dogslegde memory. I really 
    don’t like that man. There is something in his behavior that makes me 
    distrust him. I think he might be doing bad things behind people’s backs. 
    And all of his memories I recalled this far, had a nasty aftertaste. Sneaky 
    and dull. So I didn’t like him to recall my first complicated memory. The 
    possibility that some private fragments were accidentally extracted as well 
    was still on my mind. It made me fear and dislike Steward as the first to 
    upload this memory even more. Dr. Tachikawa understood my fear and I think 
    that was the reason why he wanted me to witness this upload.&nbsp; Normally it is 
    prohibited for test subjects to be present at the sessions. Dr. Hamilton had 
    already told me that he didn’t appreciate my presence. But I could stay for 
    the sake of becoming a good guide of the new-coming test subjects. Oh, yes, 
    for the sake of Dr. Tachikawa’s kicks of course! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    upload took remarkably little time, but Steward could talk for ages. He 
    obviously didn’t like the cold as much as I do. He spoke about Naoyak, the 
    daughter of Aqqaluk and Klara, who taught me to sing Greenlandic songs. But 
    he didn’t mention anything about Stig or Dr. Tachikawa. Thank God for that.</span><b><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
