    positively only last week, now I saw everything in black and white. 
    Impossible for me to get out off bed. I’m turning about in my bed. Cannot 
    sleep. Dr. Hamilton had time for me today. Obviously, he had spoken to 
    Sheila for he asked questions just for the sake of confirmation, not for the 
    answers. I tried to give him that confirmation as little as possible. I 
    denied some things. How can they prove I really heard those voices? 
    Sometimes I told them I only behaved like that just in order to get 
    attention. Although that is the last thing on my mind. It is puzzling me how 
    Dr. Hamilton could come to the same diagnosis despite my denials. Either him, 
    or Sheila knows their trade very well.</span></p>

    Damned! why Kodjiro is not here? Finally I found a man in my life with whom 
    I could share the world with, and then I’d probably never see him again! I 
    am furious but I cannot express my anger. The thought of Kodjiro not being 
    here, paralyzes me. I just want to lie down. I’m swallowed by negative 
    thoughts. It is his fault that I don’t feel well! Why he didn’t even say 
    goodbye to me? I would never betray on him. Why he desperately wanted to 
    leave? Now I also got infected by a vague psychotic disorder, damned! I 
    never have good luck, not just for once? It’s so easy to fall into a black 
    hole. To get out again, that’s a different story. I don’t give a shit, for 
    the time being. I’d rather prefer to stay in bed the rest of my life. Under 
    the blankets.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Those pills are 
    ridiculous. They gave me an enormous collection of pills. In all sorts of 
    different forms and colors. Every day one tray loaded with them. If I were 
    to choose between the sadness of now and the chaos of yesterday, I know what 
    to do. Flush them through the toilet! </span></p>
