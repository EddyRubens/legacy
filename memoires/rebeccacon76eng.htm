	<span style="font-family:Arial">I pulled from Josh's arms and ran as fast as 
	I could down the hall. I watched Diego run back into the room. My heart 
	suddenly ached, my stomach churned and my legs felt like rubber as I ran 
	into the room. Diego was on his knees beside the bed crying and saying, <i>
	&quot;No...No...No!&quot;</i> over and over. Carmen was lying in the bed, shaking, 
	shivering, and crying. There was blood all over. I climbed on the bed and 
	propped her up in my arms. I tried to stay calm. <i>&quot;Carm, what's 
	happening?&quot;</i> She looked at me and whispered, <i>&quot;My baby...don't let 
	anything happen to my baby.&quot;&nbsp; </i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">It seemed like an eternity until the Agents 
	came. They ran in the room behind Josh.&nbsp; Agent Andrews pulled out some 
	device resembling a cross between a walkie-talkie and a cell phone. <i>&quot;We 
	need emergency medical assistance immediately!&quot;</i> he yelled into it. I 
	stroked Carmen's hair out of her face and told her everything was going to 
	be okay. Her eyes were glassy and she was short breathed as she tried to 
	speak. <i>&quot;What was I thinking Becka? What did I do? This is my baby...my 
	baby.&quot;</i> She cried. <i>&quot;We're going to make it all okay.&quot;</i> I said to 
	her. <i>&quot;The Agents are getting you the best help.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">About 5 to 10 minutes passed as I sat with 
	Carmen in my arms, when finally medical help arrived. Josh took Diego into 
	the other room and the Agents made numerous calls to people 'confirming 
	arrangements.' I wasn't sure what exactly was happening since I was with 
	Carmen. Once Carmen was placed on the gurney, the emergency medic asked who 
	was going to accompany them in the helicopter taking Carmen to the hospital. 
	I jumped up and started to say that I would, but Agent Andrews interrupted 
	me. He said that Diego and Agent Jacobs would be going. I told Carmen that 
	everything was going to be okay and then they pushed her out of the room. 
	Diego and Agent Jacobs followed. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">The room was nervously quiet. Josh came back 
	into the room and put his arms around me.&nbsp; A few moments passed and I could 
	hear the helicopter flying off. I was so upset about Carmen I wasn't sure 
	what to think. All I knew was I was extremely angry with Agent Andrews for 
	not letting me go.</span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></i><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
