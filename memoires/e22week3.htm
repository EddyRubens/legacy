    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    is oh so quiet without Kodjiro. He had gone away more often, but never so 
    definitely. Any hope for him to come back seems impossible. It’s just as if 
    he is dead. His name is fiction and is pronounced only by whispering. I 
    really miss him. The idea of never ever seeing him again makes me go mad. 
    And I thought I had forgotten all about him.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Davel knocked on my 
    door. I happened to hug my rabbit which I got from Kodjiro after my 
    operation and pinched the soft animal in such a way that it changed into 
    strange shapes. Reluctantly Davel entered and sat beside me on my bed. <i>
    “So Tachikawa has gone,”</i> he said softly. I nodded my head. Then he 
    started to talk nineteen to the dozen. He argued about a girl-friend who 
    left him one day, just like that. About a teacher from school who did not 
    show up the next day and the day after. And about faithful fathers who clean 
    the faces of their children spread all over with mashed potatoes and then 
    later never come back when they go and buy a package of cigarettes. I was 
    fascinated by Davel’s happy face. I had to laugh because of him chatting all 
    the time and I pressed his side. Directly afterwards I pulled his ear. I had 
    to jump forward for he tried to grab my side. A minute later we started to 
    fool around and fell onto my bed laughing like hell. We were tickling each 
    other on every spot we could reach. Tears were coming from my eyes. I can’t 
    remember if it was showing because of laughter or because of sorrow. 
    Suddenly we fell on the floor. We stayed there for a while. My tummy was 
    sore of laughing. Davel caressed my hair and looked at me in a sweet way. So 
    what’s next? Are we going to make love after all?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Davel asked me what I thought of his body. He hadn’t gained weight. I think 
    it was good he stopped with that protein-diet. When I told him so, he was 
    shocked. <i>“Do you think I’m too fat?”</i> he asked frightened. Never 
    thought men could be so insecure about their figure as well. Davel stood in 
    front of my mirror and looked at himself seriously. <i>“I do not recognize 
    myself anymore. How come?”</i> I tried to comfort Davel. <i>“If you have 
    gained pounds so fast, it must be easy to loose them again. A bit of muscles 
    is what you want, right?”</i> Davel tried out a few poses. <i>“As a matter 
    of fact I don’t know what I really want,”</i> he said. <i>“Is it clear to 
    you?”</i> Again we started laughing. Strange feelings. We hardly know who we 
    are and even more so what we actually want.&nbsp; </span></p>
