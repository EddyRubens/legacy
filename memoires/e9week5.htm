    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Very unreal. That is 
    how I feel today. Even though I experience the Research Center and 
    especially my personal room as my home, I walk around disorientated. Like a 
    chicken that can’t find a spot to lay her egg. The recall of other persons’ 
    memories has a bigger impact than I expected. These uploads might be out of 
    my short term memory, it seems as if they truly left something behind. 
    Sometimes I feel so confused, not at all myself. I spoke about this with 
    Jessica. She didn’t find it alarming but still wanted to be kept informed. 
    Every human being is confused every now and then and everybody has doubts 
    about the meaning of life. The confusion doesn’t have to be caused by the 
    uploads. She is probably right. I might be worried for nothing, again.</span></p>

    This evening we had some kind of a special event. It is Christmas Eve, so we 
    all sat down at the fake Christmas tree, ate till we felt sick and sang some 
    songs. It was awful. I never liked Christmas. Most of the people have one or 
    two days off but I explicitly requested to work during these holy days. 
    There is nothing sadder than being alone at Christmas. So there we were; a 
    couple of lonesome people or workaholics. I spoke to Adrian, who lives too 
    far away to go home for just two days. He misses his fiancée very much. I 
    think her name is Elgin. She has to be a wonderful woman and Adrian loves 
    her very much, the way he talks about her. And I had a good chat with 
    Jessica, she was actually very kind to me. No hard feelings. Or is that an 
    essential part of the whole Christmas idea?</span></p>
