    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">A 
    splendid idea if I would find an internet-café. Through email I thought I 
    could succeed. Strangely enough I couldn’t find any possibility getting 
    online. Probably everybody here is constantly online, at home or through 
    mobile phones. Public internet facilities are not common here, or I do not 
    recognize the places as such.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">While I was searching 
    for the Tourist Information I met a man who was holding a large sign. He 
    stood still and was gazing in front of him. For a moment I asked myself if 
    he was real. I couldn’t read what was written on the sign but discovered a 
    drawing showing a red heart accompanied by a black arrow pointing diagonally. 
    Following the direction of the arrow, I saw more red hearts and red crosses 
    on the windows of the top floor. As I had nothing to do right now, and I got 
    aroused by the idea, I decided to have a look. A red heart interprets 
    medical care. I hope they can help me out over there.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">They happened to 
    donate blood. A young doctor in a white shirt was winking at me and started 
    talking in Japanese. Fortunately he also spoke English. He wanted to know my 
    blood-group. With a copy of my passport, a quick test and after three tubes 
    of blood I earned 3500 yen. The doctor advised me to keep seated for a 
    moment so I would feel much better afterwards. He gave me a 
    rich-flavored-shake filled with protein which reminded me of Davel. Would 
    this substance give me the same bunch of muscles like him? The stuff was 
    sweet as honey. A disgusting synthetic flavor of vanilla, ugh. But I did 
    empty the glass to the bottom. It helped. At once I felt much more stable.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When the doctor paid 
    me the yen, I investigated about Braintec. I asked him in simply four 
    different ways and pronounced Kodjiro’s name several times, but the doctor 
    kept shaking his head. But he did know where I could get online though. At 
    the Virgin Megastore. Six metro-stops to the north, changing direction to 
    the JRline to Ikebukuro and following the southern direction of the station. 
    I had to ask some passers-by before I definitely found the place. They were 
    right, some dozens of computers, but they were all occupied. They were 
    queuing up. No wonder, when such facilities are hard to find. Online is even 
    free of charge!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    After much patience it was my turn. It took some time before I managed to 
    produce normal letters from the keyboard. Finally I got started. A sweet 
    email for Adrian, nothing else. Nobody knew I was here. I emailed all test 
    subjects and kindly requested Dr. Tachikawa and Sonja to contact me. Then 
    Virgin closed down. Tomorrow morning I will be the first one to sit behind 
    these computers.</span></p>
