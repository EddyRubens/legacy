    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I open the 
    message, I got the answer I was looking for. <i>&quot;Yes, Agent David M. Andrews 
    is a member of the Central Intelligence Agency. (CIA) I have made contact 
    with him. He is currently waiting for a response. Would you like me to 
    connect you?&quot;</i> I looked at Carmen and said <i>&quot;What should we do?&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She told me to answer 
    them. She said if we didn't act now they were going to do an extraction from 
    her baby. She reminded me of what the outcome of that might hold. She also 
    reminded me of the position poor Megan was in and the visit I had to the 'chamber.'
    <i>&quot;Becka, we gotta get out of here! The doctors are not going to remove 
    these implants. This is our only hope.&quot;</i> I typed in a response...<i>&quot;Yes 
    please connect me.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">About a minute passed 
    by and I received a message from Agent Andrews. It read as follows; <i>&quot;Miss 
    Reynolds, It is good to finally be in contact with you. As you already know, 
    my name is Agent David M. Andrews. I am writing to you in hopes that you can 
    give my partner, Agent Marcus P. Jacobs, and I some useful information on 
    Kodjiro Tachikawa. We would like to meet with you in person.&quot;</i> I 
    responded; <i>&quot;Agent Andrews, I feel I do have some information I would like 
    to share with you. There are not many people around here that can be trusted. 
    I will only meet with you under certain circumstances. First, I have two 
    friends that are in danger. I would like for them to come with me. Second, I 
    would like to meet in a public setting. I would feel more comfortable to be 
    around other people.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The answer I received 
    was; <i>&quot; As long as you are willing to help, we are willing to meet&nbsp; 
    anywhere. There is a restaurant called Huber's not too far from where you 
    are located. Would you be willing to meet with us there?&quot;</i> I replied; <i>
    &quot;Yes that sounds fine. How about 6:00pm. We will be able to leave if we tell 
    the doctors we are going out to dinner.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Agent Andrews left one 
    last message; <i>&quot;That sounds good. I will make reservations under a code 
    name. When you arrive, tell the hostess you have reservations with the 'Justice' 
    party. I will see you then.&quot;</i></span></p>
