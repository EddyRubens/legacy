    <span style="font-family: Arial">Finally 6:00 arrived. The day felt like and 
    eternity. I have to admit that the walk through the garden really put my 
    mind at ease. It is so beautiful there! I will surely go again!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">I never thought I would be so happy to see 
    Dr. Hamilton. He smiled at me when I entered his office and said, <i>&quot;Looks 
    like you had a rough day, Kiddo!&quot;</i> I felt like saying, <i>&quot;No Shit, 
    Sherlock!&quot;</i> But I just said, <i>&quot;Yea! You can say that again!&quot;</i> So, of 
    course he did! I laughed in hope that it would make him stop!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">He asked if I was ready for my upload? I 
    was so excited I almost mentioned how much I love the ocean, but I stopped 
    in time! Close call! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">He walked me down to the room where I 
    received my first upload. Steward was already there getting things ready. I 
    was so happy, then I saw Sheila. She walked over and asked if everything was 
    all right. I said I was just a little tired and would be fine. She said she 
    was going to make an appointment for me to see her. I told her to just let 
    me know when. I basically was just trying to get her to leave me alone!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">When everything was set in place, the last 
    thing I remember Dr. Hamilton saying was, <i>&quot;Prepare to enjoy!&quot; </i>Then I 
    was there! It was an Ocean on the West coast. A place called Dillion's Beach. 
    (From what the sign read.) It started out where I was walking down this 
    paved road with a bunch of peaceful ocean front cabins on both sides. I 
    think I must have came from one of them. I walked down the road a bit 
    further when it went down in a hill-like fashion. When I got to the bottom I 
    walked through the small parking area then right onto the sandy beach. It 
    was so cold and windy. I could smell the salty water and hear the loud 
    seagulls gawking and flying above me. I walked along the beach a for a while, 
    watching people throw sticks to dogs and watching little kids play in the 
    water. I remember thinking how cold it must be in that water. The little 
    kids didn't seem to notice at all. That made me smile. I walked as far as I 
    could until there was a large rock in the way. No problem I thought, I would 
    climb it. I reached the top. It felt like I was on top of the world. It was 
    marvelous! That was it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">When it was done, I wanted to do it all 
    over again. Dr. Hamilton asked which upload I enjoyed better, The Jets or 
    the Ocean? I told him there was no way I could compare the two. I wanted to 
    leave so bad so that I could find Carmen. I was in much better spirits and 
    had a feeling she found the gift and was too. Except, I had to sit and share 
    every detail I experienced for my files. Dr. Hamilton mentioned that the 
    experience I had was completely different from the other two people who 
    received it. Apparently, the other two test subjects felt sadness and 
    despair, and when they climbed the rock, it was because they were going to 
    jump off it to end it all.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">That was the last thing I would have 
    thought while on top of that rock. And, come to think of it, why would Dr. 
    Hamilton purposely give me what he thought was a depressing upload? I 
    thought he liked me. I did laugh at his stupid jokes! O'well, I got 
    something good out of it!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">I am waiting in Dr. Hamilton's office. He 
    said he wants me to see something, then he will let me go back to my room. I 
    wonder what he wants to show me?</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
