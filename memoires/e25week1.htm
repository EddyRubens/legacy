    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Japanese is really a 
    very strange language. In this particular plane mostly Japanese passengers 
    and I cannot understand one word. A pity, for after that last upload with 
    Adrian I was hoping I would understand the Japanese language from now on. No 
    way. Actually normal in one way. Memories are only registered in the 
    short-term-memory and in that way you can never ever learn a foreign 
    language. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    flight lasted not as long as I thought. Only 13 hours all together, changing 
    flight in San Francisco. I thought Japan was situated on the other end of 
    the world. Starting from Portland it is not that bad after all. I wanted to 
    stay in San Francisco for a while, I almost did. Only forty minutes left 
    between two flights and if I hadn’t found the right gate in time I would 
    have booked a next flight at the end of the afternoon. That would have given 
    me enough time to visit Jessica’s home. I wonder if she still lives there. 
    Maybe she is at home right now! This idea came up too late otherwise I would 
    have planned so. My rucksack with overnight-stuff would fly directly to 
    Tokyo anyway. Those items wouldn’t guarantee a good-night sleep, but the 
    idea of sleeping on the streets of San Francisco without my sleeping-bag was 
    not my cup of tea. So I boarded the second plane and am listening to the 
    loud conversations, not to be understood, of my neighbors. </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    amazes me that people can pronounce such amazing sounds.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Luxurious plane 
    indeed. At the back of the seat in front of me there is a video-monitor. I 
    am curious to know whether Japan is indeed the high-tech-country I’ve always 
    been told. Everybody dealing with a mobile-phone contacting one another 
    continuously. Must be expensive over there. For that matter I hope I can 
    find Braintec’s office on the spot. I haven’t got more than a few dollars. 
    Moreover I am anxious to know what I’m going through soon. At this moment I 
    haven’t got the slightest idea what I’m intending to do when I arrive. 
    Standing at Narita Airport, and then what? I might ask the man at the 
    customer’s where I can find Dr. Tachikawa’s office? Wished I remembered the 
    name of that company Kodjiro wanted to deal with. They should be able to 
    help me there. The only guideline I have is Sonja. Although I don’t have a 
    clue where she is now. Anyway I can email her.</span></p>
