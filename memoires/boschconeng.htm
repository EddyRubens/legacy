    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I have met rosanne in 
    haarlem while she was busy to recruit test subjects for braintec. I had a 
    small chat with her and i liked it immediately. I have been interested in 
    the future about technology since a long time ago and i love 
    science-fiction, i also watch discovery or national-geographic channel 
    regularly. So you can imagine that this appealed to me very much. I could 
    see it all happening. Then i have registered myself as a test subject. After 
    i filled in a couple of forms and after i have been in contact with them for 
    several times i heard that i would go to america on the 20th of november. 
    From schiphol with a 747 to new-york, and i shall go by train to 
    portland-oregon because i prefer to travel by train so i will take my 
    change. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">For weeks i can only 
    think of one thing, and that is how it all will go at braintec and what 
    there will happen with the tests because i first have to pass them. I am 
    curious if it will become a m.s.i. or a m.e.s.i . well what does it matter 
    whatever it will be it is already so cool at least that’s what i think. Not 
    everybody in my environment is so enthusiastic as i am. Most people find it 
    unbelievable and they say :be careful there in america because you never 
    know what they shall do to you and there is no-one there who can help you if 
    that is necessary. But i have a full trust that it’s okay at braintec. After 
    all the information and conversations with them i go to it for the full 
    100%. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">After the usual saying 
    goodbye to family at schiphol it was finally time to go to the states. I 
    like to fly but it mustn’t take too long, but a couple of nice movies made 
    it a lot better so it was okay after all. After the arrival in new york I 
    have given my eyes a good view, i love abstract buildings and there is 
    really everything big depending on architecture. By the way everything is 
    huge there and much and more. What is that a different world unbelievable so 
    different than ours. I have been to foreign countries before but never 
    further than greece or turkey and that is not to compare with america. But 
    okay, i went with the bus to the railway station, and i bought a ticket to 
    portland. The trains there are very different then ours much more beautiful 
    and much faster, at least that is what i think. I have met very nice people 
    in the train, americans are kind i always thought of them being rough and 
    heavy but that image seems to be wrong. &nbsp;After a view cosey chats about 
    joints and wooden shoes i arrived in </span>
    <span style="font-family:
  Arial">portland</span><span style="font-family:Arial">. I would be picked up 
    at the station so i stayed at a spot where there were more people waiting to 
    be picked up by normal cars. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">After approximately ten 
    minutes john mc kenzie from braintec picked me up and brought me to the 
    B.R.S.(braintec research center.) there some assistants and the director 
    j.j. hamilton welcomed me. I recognized him from the pictures i had seen 
    from braintec. My luggage was taken and i have got a viewing of my new home. 
    It is a center with everything a center has to have a bit sterile but okay, 
    they operate here surgically so that is understandable. It really looks like 
    a private clinic i share a room with a boy who is here for to weeks already, 
    he has today off. &nbsp;So i will meet him later i have now some time for myself 
    before the evening dinner. It all makes a heavy impact on me though. I 
    really have the feeling as if i arrived at a different planet. Different 
    language, people, atmosphere, ect,ect. But okay i like new challenges and i 
    can respond to my new environment easily. So that will be all fine. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I keep it to this and 
    continue before bedtime. So i share my room with steve &nbsp;his diary is also to 
    read at braintec i believe. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">We have been eating nicely all 
    together. I have met two other test subjects, robert and sonja. Robert has a 
    mesi-implant so that is interesting. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">
    But i will sure speak to him. Jessica and sheila are test psychologists and 
    i will have to deal with them the first days, because tomorrow is the first 
    of two testing days and those are very important because than will be 
    decided if i stay or if i go home. Tomorrow i get a psychology and 
    intelligent, health test and a brain scan. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">So that will become a bussy day. 
    Goodnight america. Day 1&nbsp; 20 november 2002.</span></p>
