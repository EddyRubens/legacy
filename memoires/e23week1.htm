    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    situation in which Sheila found me this morning had reached a decisive 
    factor. For a while she had been walking around with a strange suspect and 
    now it was time to talk about it with me. Sheila thinks I have a schizoid 
    psychosis. Something between schizophrenia and a psychosis if I’m not 
    mistaken. It sounds that way. We have been dealing with it almost all day.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I had an appointment 
    with her, but I didn’t show up. Sheila visited me in my room and she found 
    me there. I can vaguely remember something in that direction. I wanted to be 
    left alone. Sheila asked me what was wrong and I didn’t feel like answering. 
    She kept asking me questions, very boring. When she finally left the room, I 
    hid myself into the cupboard. I knew she would be back soon. First she 
    searched the bathroom and a few minutes later she found me in the cupboard. 
    I was squeezed between my rucksack and some clothes hanging. <i>“Are we 
    going to play hide-and-seek?”</i> Sheila asked. Actually I should have 
    kicked her into her face. Who the hell she thinks I was, an elderly woman?
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In one way or another 
    Sheila always manages to get me under control by letting me think in a 
    logical way. Anyway, she pursued me to swallow a huge red pill. I was 
    swallowing this mega-smartie while I was still in the cupboard. It didn’t 
    make sense staying in there any longer. Sheila told me we had to discuss a 
    few items and suggested to follow her to her office. There she told me what 
    she suspected all the time.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The syndrome scared me 
    a lot. I cannot help thinking about schizophrenia without imagining most 
    tragic cases in mental hospitals. Creatures totally strangers in this world 
    and who can never play an accepted role in society again. I got down-hearted 
    on the spot. Sheila trivialized her diagnosis and reminded me at the fact 
    that she is not a psychiatrist. Probably I have dealt with so much emotions 
    and information which had become all too much for me. According to her, 
    receiving memories of somebody else cannot be without risks in the long run. 
    If symptoms prove the causes of uploads, it would be a good idea to stop 
    them temporarily in order to recover. The frightful idea I get when I deal 
    with schizophrenia and psychosis calmed me down a bit realizing I’m not able 
    to get my weekly uploads for the time being. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Right now, reflecting the whole situation in my bed, I think differently 
    about it. I do not see any reason why I shouldn’t get new uploads any more. 
    Sheila gave me medicine to suppress the psychosis. Neuroleptics. Those pills 
    are pretty good. Haven’t heard any voices since and I seem to be closer to 
    myself more than ever. Although I suffer from a headache and a sore throat. 
    Why can’t I get any uploads now that this medicine helps me out? And why Dr. 
    Hamilton, who is a real psychiatrist, has no time for me?</span></p>
