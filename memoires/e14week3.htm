    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">So 
    it had been a very busy day with three presentations after each other. I was 
    watching the clock continuously and no time was left for me to complete and 
    finish it. Although I succeeded. ‘Coss I reached many people. In the morning 
    in museum the Vleeshal in Haarlem, in the afternoon and in the evening back 
    in Rotterdam.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Remarkably many people 
    love to talk about science-fiction films or books. <i>“Have you seen the 
    latest movie? In it you can really do this or that. Do you think it is 
    possible in real life soon?”</i> Besides that they have frequently asked me 
    questions whether it is possible to register different information instead 
    of memories, like for example a Chinese dictionary. Useful when you are 
    going to travel. I happen to talk about it with Kodjiro and Steward just a 
    week and a half ago. It is not part of the Braintec’s research and that’s 
    why we don’t do it. But theoretically speaking we do not exclude the 
    possibility. Obviously the results could be negative, because all 
    information will be saved in the short time memory. When, for instance, you 
    copy all information from such a Chinese dictionary to the brains you will 
    not find any connection between individual words and you will miss the 
    grammatical sentences to apply to the linguistics. It will act as if 
    somebody has read all words very fast. After such an upload you are not able 
    to read any Chinese, not even speak nor understand. Maybe through regular 
    uploading of complete language courses there are possibilities of something 
    like a speed training method.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Speculations on futuristic possibilities are favored during my presentations.&nbsp; 
    Enthusiastic visitors ventilate their visions on the future and their 
    opinions. So much enthusiasm from a boy of Groningen when I talked to him 
    this morning in Haarlem I have not yet met before with my future test 
    subjects. His name is Michael and he has been test subject before in another 
    research. He couldn’t wait any longer to register. I hope he persists. Today 
    again about twelve people showed serious interest in becoming a test 
    subject. First we still have to see who is really coming to Portland. But if 
    I’m honest to myself I truly hope Michael is among them. ‘Coss he seemed a 
    kind boy to me.</span></p>
