    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The plane arrived an 
    hour early. I have already collected my two suitcases from the luggage 
    conveyer belt thing and hit up a Wendy's inside the Airport here. This 
    square burger makes me laugh, but it just melts in my mouth! I don't know 
    how people can stand that airplane food. I was served potato soup which I 
    though was Clam Chowder at first. Once I took a bite I knew I was horribly 
    mistaken! Then along with it, a dry sandwich. They were calling it ham, but 
    I've never tasted ham that was crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle! 
    &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">At least I'm on solid 
    ground now, and away from my smelly seat partner, Norman Ash. I have to 
    admit, I did have a nice conversation with him after brunch. He talked about 
    how he had to attend a funeral of a good friend of his who lived on the East 
    coast. He laughed and talked about all the good times they had as &quot;young 
    men.&quot; He got a little teary when he mentioned the last time seeing him was 
    12 years ago. (Mental note to self: Be sure to visit Carrie every chance you 
    get!) This all leads me to believe that these MSI and MESI implants are 
    completely ideal and humane to the lives of people. I bet Norman would pay 
    everything had to just relive one of those great memories he had with his 
    friend Frank.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Once I finish this 
    cheeseburger and fries I will walk to the front of the airport to see if my 
    ride to Braintec is here. I am eager to get settled and meet Dr. Hamilton in 
    person. He mentioned a guided tour after my arrival which I </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">am also looking forward 
    to.</span></p>
