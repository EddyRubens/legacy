    unconditionally and without limits? The one who translates all my youthful

    Who smiles at all my disgusting habits and who pushes me against the door to

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I immediately believed 
    my mother when she told me that Santa Claus doesn’t exist. It was too 
    unpredictable that someone could become so old. A man of that age could no 
    longer foster my fantasies. Even though I was very shocked through her 
    explanations and felt uncertain for a while. But when I mentioned that the 
    amount of Christmas presents did not increase, I did no longer mourn over 
    his sudden death. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">But no matter how often 
    I’ve been told that the prince on his white horse doesn’t exist; I have 
    never believed it. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Of 
    course I pretend to know better. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I 
    have learned through the years how to pretend that I shake off my daydreams 
    and claim to know better with a smile. But I always keep my fingers crossed. 
    Once the fairy will come for me and she will show me the way to my prince 
    with her magic wand. Then the long and lonely days comes to an end. All my 
    misfortune will melt as snow and my happiness will be of pure gold. My 
    prince will get me out of here. Away of this cold research center. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Far away from all those white 
    coats. Better today than tomorrow. </span></p>
