	I don't really know what to say. I suppose this letter is written in 
	response to the letter you sent me. But, first I wanted to know who Kaleb 
	is. You must have used my computer and forgot to sign off. I wasn't snooping 
	through your uplink or anything, but I couldn't help but notice that you 
	have been emailing him. Please, just be honest with me. And as for your 
	letter...all I have to say is, Baby, what are you talking about? I swear 
	your having bad reactions to that implant thing. You mentioned all these bad 
	things that happened at the hotel last night, but Sweetheart, you must have 
	dreamed that. Remember how we use to laugh about how you had dreams that you 
	thought were real...then you would wake up mad at me? You mean to tell me 
	that in your mind, the night we shared is a blank. I remember the shower, 
	Honey, but my recollection is a little different from yours. And what pills 
	are you talking about? The only pill I saw you take was your birth control 
	pill. As for the Agents attacking you,...come on! Do you think I would ever 
	let that happen to my girl? The only thing they did was tell you about the 
	plan they made to help get you out of there? Do you remember that? What does 
	Carmen say? Do you even remember her coming to get you to drive you back to 
	Braintec? I think you just got confused, Baby. </span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">O'God, no! They got to my Josh!&nbsp; I know I'm 
	not losing my mind!&nbsp; It's just what they want me to think. I know what's 
	really going on. I know the real truth. The truth about Tachikawa and how he 
	changed his name. I know that he was fired from the CIA, that he kidnaps 
	women, and that he masterminded some sick and twisted plan with three little 
	innocent babies. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I was able to help Megan, even if I only 
	played a small role in it. Now I am going to do everything I can to help 
	Carmen and her baby. I will have to ask Agent Davis and Mr. Isakova's 
	friends what I should do about Josh. We have to think of a way to get him 
	and Diego away from those bad Agents. I won't leave here without him. I 
	won't!</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
