	I explained to the guys that it was getting late and I had to get back to my 
	room. I wanted to make sure that the copies and the pass were still hidden.
	<i>&quot;Wait Rebecca...&quot;</i> Thomas said, <i>&quot;That's not all...there's more.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	I sat back down on the bed with dread. I didn't want to hear more. I didn't 
	want to know how things could get worse.
	Jerry said from the papers that Thomas took, he found out that Jenna, 
	Simone, and Carmen were all being flown out of here tonight with their 
	babies.
	He continued on saying that in the papers they found, it mentioned how Dr. 
	Tachikawa was really pissed because something he was planning went amiss. In 
	order to quench his thirst for authority and control, he decided to retrieve 
	'Generation 3' (with their mom's), and start on whatever it was that he had 
	planned for them. <i>&quot;Since the three signed contracts for him,&quot; 
	</i>Jerry said. <i>&quot;Dr. Tachikawa has 
	priority over Dr. Hamilton, so he reassigned them to a new location. They're 
	headed for Japan.&quot;&nbsp; </i>They took Jenna and Trent (her son) earlier. I saw them taking Simone. Her 
	daughter, Stella must have been taken a different way, which would explain 
	why she was so upset. But, what about Carmen? Wasn't Max too small to be 
	taken on a plane? </span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	I knew instantly which plan of Dr. Tachikawa's went amiss, it was Megan 
	getting away. I knew he wanted her for information he thought she had about 
	the KGB, and that plan was foiled. But, what did those babies have to offer? 
	They didn't have any secret information that could be used in warfare.
	There was nothing else to be said so I stood up and started to head back to 
	my room. Before I opened the door, I told Thomas and Jerry about the help 
	that was coming for me tomorrow and I told them that I wanted them to leave 
	with me.<br>
	<i>&quot;I know Dr. Tachikawa is gone but I still don't feel comfortable leaving you 
	guys here.&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;If you come with me I'll know you're safe. Then, we can 
	tell Agent Davis and Mr. Isakova's friends about Carmen, Jenna, and Simone 
	being taken to Japan. I know they'll help.&quot; </i>They both got a look of hope and relief on their faces, and they agreed to 
	leave here with me. I told them to be ready to go tomorrow evening, by 
	5:00pm.&nbsp; We agreed to meet in my room at that time, then I left. </span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	I went back to my room and found a note on my bed. There was a chocolate 
	monkey sitting on top of it. I knew immediately who it was from...Carmen. 
	The note read: <i>&quot;Becca, Tachikawa sent for us. Going to Japan. Pleas............&quot; 
	</i>It looked 
	as though she didn't have time to finish what she was going to write, but I 
	already knew what was not written, she needed help. </span></p>
