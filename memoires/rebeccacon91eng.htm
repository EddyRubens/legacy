	<span style="font-family:Arial">As soon as I woke up this morning, I hurried 
	to take a shower and get ready. I wanted to get to Thomas' room as soon as 
	possible. He said he would get me into the &quot;Left Wing' and I was positively 
	going to take him up on his offer! </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I was ready, I left to go meet with 
	Thomas. Along the way, Rosanne and Adrian passed me in the hall. I mine as 
	well have not existed because they were so caught up in their conversation I 
	don't think they even noticed me. They both were walking towards the front 
	door. I am assuming they were heading to Elisa's bar, downtown. Elisa's was 
	sort of a private place that Carmen and I had passed a few times but never 
	cared to enter. The two of then were known to go there often. I was actually 
	suprised Rosanne was even allowed to go back into the bar. I heard some of 
	the test subject say that she went on a rampage in there once, throwing 
	chairs and breaking things.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic">
	<a target="_top" href="e15link5.htm">find out about Elisa's bar</a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Once they were out of site I knocked on 
	Thomas' door. No one answered, so I knocked again. Still no answer. I was 
	starting to get worried when I realized I never scheduled where we would 
	meet. Maybe he thought we were supposed to meet at the front desk so that's 
	where I headed next. When I reached the front counter, Thomas was not there 
	but Jerry was. <i>&quot;Hi Jerry,&quot;</i> I said. &quot;<i>Have you seen Thomas? Or do 
	you know where he might be?&quot; </i></span>
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">&quot;Yea, he was here about 
	fifteen minutes ago and said he was just scheduled for an upload. He 
	mentioned that he was suprised that he was getting another one so quickly 
	since he just had one last night....But he wanted me to give you this.&quot;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Jerry handed me a plastic covered pass to 
	the 'Left Wing.'&nbsp; It was attached to a red shoelace style lanyard with the 
	word 'Braintec' repeatedly printed in white letters. My guess was that I was 
	supposed to wear this pass around my neck when entering the 'Left Wing.' 
	While staring at the pass and slowly walking away, Jerry said to me, <i>&quot;You 
	better make sure you are back before 2:30pm. It says here that you are 
	scheduled for an upload at that time. If you miss it and they find out it 
	was because you were in the 'Left Wing'......&quot;&nbsp; </i>He just ended his 
	sentence like that but I knew exactly what he was trying to say.<i> &quot;Thanks 
	Jerry!&quot;</i> I said as I walked away.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I think I was so caught up in what I was 
	doing that that thought of receiving an upload was the least of my worries. 
	The last one I received was sad and depressing, but that must have been 
	Tachikawa's doing. I didn't really want another one in fear that it would be 
	the same. But, another side of me wanted just one more, something fantastic 
	and beautiful, before I got the MESI taken out.</span></p>
