    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I never knew such 
    large cards existed! Sonja and I thought it a wise idea to buy the largest 
    one in order to succeed in our plan. That will encourage people to write 
    down some more text. Anyway more than just a name. Of course the new test 
    subjects didn’t know who Robbert was and found it rather stupid to 
    participate. That didn’t matter. They were crossed off our list anyway. 
    Every time it was exciting to see what had been written by them. Or as a 
    matter of fact how it was written. Those stimulating texts were meant 
    seriously and from the heart obviously but we didn’t care less about the 
    contents.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">In 
    the meantime we checked on all test subjects. At first the anonymous sender 
    did not seem to be between them. Naturally we still had to check it 
    thoroughly. But first we had to collect the handwritings of the doctors and 
    other employees. We managed to get a few sentences without a blush of the 
    girl in the laundry and the Caribbean cleaner. I found it harder when 
    approaching higher functions. What would happen if they discover our story? 
    It did not bother Sonja at all. Without knocking she opened the door to Dr. 
    Hamilton’s office and put the card in front of his nose. <i>“It is really 
    true?”</i> the director asked worried. <i>“At the beginning of next week he 
    will visit us for a late inspection. Then we must spend some time on this.”</i> 
    After this remark I did not dare to continue. Maybe Sonja thinks I’m a 
    coward but I found it more important not to loose control of myself. We 
    should examine it now with the handwritings we had been collecting.</span></p>
