    yet another plane. I'm not to happy with my seat. I have a window seat, row 
    14, on the right side of the plane. That part is fine, but I unfortunately 
    am stuck sitting next to an older man (maybe in his 60's or early 70's) who 
    smells of Bengay camouflaged with way to much cologne. I am starting to get 
    a bit of a headache! I have a feeling this is going to be a long flight!&nbsp;</span></p>

    about my decision and argued with me not to go. I don't think I eased his

    and on about <i>&quot;What if you have seizures like that one girl&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;What 
    if something goes wrong.&quot;</i>&nbsp; I explained that I was only going for testing 
    and to learn more about it. I told him because of some phobias I have, I 
    probably won't get picked anyway. He still wasn't too happy. I know he's 
    only looking out for my best interest, and I have to admit that I am 
    flattered that he cares so much! In the end, I promised I would email him 
    every night, and he promised he would take care of my big baby, Bruce.&nbsp;</span></p>

    attendant with the food cart.&nbsp; I think I will ask her for some aspirin when 
    she brings my meal. Fortunately that seems to be the only thing I forgot to 
    bring. After I eat I will try to take a short nap. I didn't sleep much last
