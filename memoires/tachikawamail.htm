        <p><i><font face="Arial" color="#000000">You asked me to try if it is possible to use the new M-stores in my 
        Dream On Screen project. Well, I found it possible, but I need some more 
        time and money to get it all work out. First I need somebody with 
        knowhow of multiprocessing in a network. And, in the second place: I 
        think it would be better if we talk about my payment. A &quot;little&quot; raise 
        will make it a lot easier for me. And last but not least. I need a 
        testee during the experiments. It would be easy if it is somebody who is 
        not afraid for any upload at all. In this case I think that Rosanne is 
        the best possible person in this place. As you know: She loves Uploads 
        more than anyone else I know.I hope we can come to an agreement in the 
        cases I mentioned above. Have a good time and answer me quick please,</font></i></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>Answer:</b> Dear Adrian,<br>
        First of all I'd like to say that it's nice to hear from you. I am 
        having a good time, thank you. I'm very glad the new M-Stores are 
        compatible. Of course you need more money. It is a bit difficult to 
        organize that overseas. Wouldn't it be much easier if you join us here 
        in Tokyo? We are making a lot of money and technical skills are always 
        provided. I approve your proposal concerning Rosanne. In my opinion, she 
        is probably the best for our new experiments. She'll insist on 
        everything as long as she can get her upload. Perhaps you can take her 
        with you?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Just let me know if you're 
        interested in the job, let's say for ten times the usual amount, and 
        I'll send you the tickets right away.</font></p>
