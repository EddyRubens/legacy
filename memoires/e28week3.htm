    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><b>Today I met Sonja 
    again! My heart skipped three heartbeats when I saw her. I was strolling 
    along the streets close to the blood bank when suddenly I saw her crossing 
    the street. She was heading my direction! I rushed over to her and called 
    her name. When she recognized me, she turned round and started running away 
    from me. She disappeared into the crowd. I haven’t found her since.</b>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">It all happened so fast 
    that I find it hard understanding what’s going on with me. Of course I was 
    happy to see her, surprised and excited at the same. When she started 
    running, I had most strange feelings. I think I was even screaming. I 
    recognized her as being a sort of object meant for me. I had to get her and 
    should possess her. The way she looked at me in such a scary way, was 
    arousing me. Yacht instinct appeared. I didn’t fancy her as a prey but as a 
    sexual object. I had to mate with her!&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I collapsed in the 
    street, defeated. I couldn’t care less that I was in the middle of the 
    street. The hell with all Japanese good manners. Sonja had escaped! For days 
    I was hoping to meet her and now she ran away from me! Did I scare her 
    through my ridiculous behavior? Did she actually see that my behavior 
    suddenly was fundamental? I think I was running on both my legs. Glad I did. 
    Imagine if I would follow her jumping on my hands and my feet! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    was fed up with everything and was dealing with my disappointment. I’m sure 
    there would be another chance. Hopefully I didn’t scare Sonja too much and 
    we could have a great time together next time. All my thoughts were 
    interrupted by a man who was sitting on his heels. It was the doctor! The 
    physician who took blood from me the other day and took me to the meeting! 
    Again he passed me over me a city-plan. <i>“Come to this location tomorrow 
    morning at ten. Then many questions will be answered.”</i> He continued 
    walking. Surprisingly I was looking at this small piece of paper. 
    Immediately I put it in my pocket. Answer to my questions. Sounds 
    interesting. </span></p>
