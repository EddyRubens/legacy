    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Today’s upload threw 
    into a commotion. It was my remembrance which had been extracted from my 
    memory earlier this week. I was given the free choice to choose a memory I 
    wanted. They asked me to choose a moment any test subject would love to 
    experience again. With that choice they had a lot of faith in me. Maybe I 
    had broken that confidence. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Who 
    doesn’t want to believe that he saw a UFO for a moment? I thought it would 
    be a great experience. Anyway a memory I would definitely like to experience 
    again. It was somewhere in the country where apple trees disappeared into 
    agriculture. That evening I was jumping at an open air concert, a 
    festival for experimental music held in the neighborhood. It was already 
    midnight or actually early in the morning and I didn’t want to go home yet. 
    I wanted to go for a walk and my boy-friend was walking behind me. After we 
    were taken by surprise through the beautiful round apples in the orchard, I 
    saw this huge white mobile. The traditional forms of it exactly described 
    that we were dealing with a UFO. Silly enough I was not astonished at all. 
    But I was very much excited. Adventure! The terrestrial spaceship attracted 
    me in a strong way. <i>“A UFO!”</i> I shouted at my boy-friend and rushed to 
    it. <i>“No, wait!”</i> he answered frightened. <i>“It might be dangerous!”</i> 
    The white metal glittered at me in the early morning sun. How I longed to be 
    introduced to the drivers! When the ship was only at a distance of a few 
    meters, I saw that the glittering metal was not metal but white agricultural 
    plastic. And the round portholes were car tires holding the plastic in its 
    place. I started to laugh out loud. I explained the misunderstanding to my 
    boy-friend, and slowly he dared to come closer. It was such a funny 
    situation! So extraordinary and so intensive!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was Kathy who got 
    this upload first and she did not feel well afterwards. Then later Adrian 
    got the upload who was not afraid anymore for strange side effects after his 
    experience with Steward’s memory. He really liked my memory and he asked me 
    if he could have it again within a short time. We all understood that seeing 
    a UFO does not need to be in favor of everybody. Only when I went through my 
    own UFO-experience again I understood that something had gone wrong. That 
    night I forgot I had taken a trip! After that experience I again remembered 
    much more what I had gone through that night. How I wanted to eat one of the 
    apples in the orchard and how the small stalk suddenly changed into a worm 
    when I had a first bite. How my legs were moving mechanically when I was 
    walking. How strange the morning dew felt on my eye-lashes and how I got 
    afraid to be intoxicated when I saw a sprinkler. It was a strange night 
    which I will always treasure as a good memory caused by that so-called UFO. 
    The hallucinatory aspect I completely forgot because during that time I was 
    so often under the influence of triptamines that it felt natural. I never 
    mentioned it when I registered myself as a test subject. Do I have to 
    mention it this time?</span></p>
