    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Since Tachikawa showed 
    me how the new M-stores work, I’m mostly in the laboratory during the nights 
    to find out how I can get the images attached to the memories visible on 
    screen without the interference of a human being. But I make the same fault 
    over and over again. The images restart every time. I get some images for a 
    half of a second and that repeats itself. The total capacity of the whole 
    computer network is necessary to view all those half-second-images and to 
    puzzle them together and perhaps that gives troubles as well. Here I’ve 
    reached the end of my knowledge. It is four o’clock in the morning and I 
    decide to stop for the time being. That Tachikawa can be stolen! I shall 
    send him an e-mail saying that it is possible, but with more money, more 
    computer capacity and more knowledge. It’s time he’ll start paying me more 
    for all my efforts. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">While I walk back from 
    the lab towards my room I see someone walking outside who reminds me at 
    somebody I know from home, from Elgin. A friend of mine who knows all about 
    networks and combining computing powers. After all, he has studied for that 
    as a mathematician. That gives me an idea. I walk back as fast as I can and 
    write him a message asking him to help me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I already have an 
    answer the next morning. And how he could help me. A whole package of 
    attachments with manuals, programs and all the knowhow I need. Get going 
    with it. It takes me a whole day to install al the software. I have to work 
    during the night, otherwise the whole network is used by the staff. After 
    two nights working on a very simple M-store it must be possible to knit 
    several images together. It will become an image of nothing, but every first 
    step is a difficult one. </span></p>
