    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>I have made a long 
    walk with Sonja. We wanted to visit the Japanese garden and decided to go 
    there on foot. Therefore we were already tired when we arrived at the garden 
    and we dropped ourselves on one of the first benches. I guess I like Sonja, 
    not only because she speaks Dutch. She has some sort of restful feeling 
    which comforts me. Maybe because she is a bit older. Or perhaps because she 
    is from Belgium. Her choice of words and her accent are warm and soft. That 
    is nice.</b>&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Sonja has some 
    difficulties settling down at Braintec. I think she still doesn’t understand 
    why she is here. She came in contact with Braintec through her husband. She 
    didn’t say it with so many words, but I guess things were at a deadlock at 
    home. Within a couple of weeks at Braintec she hopes to get her thoughts 
    back on the rails. Perhaps only my interpretations; I sincerely hope so. 
    ‘Coss Braintec is not a nursing home. The uploads can confuse you even more 
    if you’re mentally not strong enough. But I’m probably completely mistaken 
    and project my own uncertainties on her. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was caused by her 
    words about the old year. I asked her if she didn’t prefer to come one week 
    later, so she would be able to celebrate New Year’s Eve with her husband at 
    home. <i>“No,”</i> she answered frankly. <i>“If I have something on my mind, 
    I wish to go for it immediately. A new year, a new beginning.”</i>&nbsp; That was 
    all she wanted to say about it. She wanted to know a lot about my time at 
    Braintec. I have softened the sharpness of the facts a bit but I did tell 
    her about the epilepsy. That seems to be fair. It didn’t shock her at all. 
    After that I told her about Greenland and then she wanted to know if I miss 
    the Netherlands. My confirmation came out very abrupt. Yes, I might miss the 
    Netherlands more than I thought. The language, that’s for sure, but also the 
    people. Family, friends and even people I hardly know. Sometimes I dream 
    about them. How are they today? Did my sister find a new boyfriend yet? Did 
    my friends get the recognition for their art, which they worked so hard for? 
    It was time to change subject, ‘coss I started to feel weak. Let’s talk 
    about Steward and Jessica. If you gossip, you can get yourself out of the 
    picture. </span></p>
