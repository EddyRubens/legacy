    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Day 3, 
    evening.&nbsp; About seven in the evening they told me that i had past all of the 
    tests and that i will get a M.E.S.I. implant tomorrow. I can’t tell you how 
    happy i feel right now. This morning i had to make the final psychological 
    tests. And as usually i did a fine job, the last few tests were about the 
    daily questions of live.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;They 
    wanted to know how i would react if overnight the world would change into a 
    planet with only a few people and animals left. Well i said that i will try 
    to make the best of the situation and really try to survive instead of 
    making yourself real crazy with the idea that there is nothing left, no more 
    electricity or computers. You will have to start all over again. First think 
    of the things you need and try to find them, when you succeed an can 
    survive, then try to make an alliance with the rest of the people that are 
    left. To try and work together so that everybody will survive and maybe live 
    a (normal) life until they die. They said that my answer had a great sense 
    of compassion for other human beings and myself of course. So i said: hey 
    it’s better to work together than to work alone. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">But i,m 
    glad that the first series of tests are over now. I want to get on with it. 
    At one o,clock this afternoon they came to pick me up for the hypno-session 
    to try an establish if i would get an implant at all, and if so wich one the 
    M.S.I. or the M.E.S.I.&nbsp; i was quite nervous about it because i was never 
    hypnotised before in my life, some times you see in the movies that people 
    get hypnotised by swinging a watch in front of their eye’s. And i never 
    thought that it would really work for real. But that was exactly what they 
    used on me, in the beginning when they started i was real sceptical but 
    within, i think one minute, i was GONE!!!. I slipped in a deep trance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
    Everything went black all of a sudden, and it felt like i was falling for a 
    long time it did not stop until i woke up in a lonely and deserted place. 
    Walking along there was a deserted mining town, wich i entered. There were a 
    few buildings that seemed to light up in the dark evening sky. There was 
    nobody in this town, as far as i know. I was drawn towards the hole in the 
    ground where the miners used to enter the mine. Walking along in the pit, 
    the road was endless. The road was winding down and got deeper and deeper. 
    When i looked up i could not see the world anymore. It was really scary down 
    there i felt very small. All of a sudden i heard a voice and at first i 
    thought it was god calling my name. When he started to ask all kinds of 
    questions. I told him everything he wanted to know .at the end he said to 
    me, that i could come back if i was ready for it in 5,4,3,2,1, and then i 
    opened my eye’s after a few moments i knew that this was the way i reacted 
    on a hypnosession. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">This was 
    heavy man!!!. This gives you something to think about. The people who were 
    present at the session told me. that i remembered a very happy moment in my 
    past life. In the ancient rome about 1500 years ago i was a priest in (what 
    we now call) the vatican. I was the adviser of the pope, who was seen as a 
    god in those day’s .my task was talk with him and try and pick out the 
    things that he should see to. In that time there were two cardinals by the 
    name of:symmachus from 498-514 and laurentius 498-505. they fought over the 
    same place and symmachus won the battle. The other got killed. I do not know 
    if he did it himself, but i know that he was behind it. Because i didn’t 
    care who was the right pope at the time, but at least i still had my things 
    to do so i stayed one as the adviser. it was a happy time because if you had 
    a job like mine you would have everything you wanted and more!!. Secretly 
    there were enough girls and even boys for some high ranked people. I started 
    my work when i was 27 and i stayed untill i died when i was 52.&nbsp; they will 
    try and save this memory for the later complex extraction on day 26, they 
    told me later. So maybe i can put some images on the inter-net later on. 
    Something different now, i had to pack up my little possessions that i have 
    here and move to the left wing of this building. Do not ask me why?, but i 
    think that it’s more efficient like this. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Today i 
    called home for the first time, to tell them that i could stay and was not 
    coming home. They were happy to here from me. My mother told me that the cat 
    gave birth to 4 kittens, she will sent me some pictures of theme. Everybody 
    was fine and they said to go for it so maybe i can become the greatest 
    test-person in the whole world. I will call them in a few days again. Well 
    goodnight for now. sleep well. A big day tomorrow :SERGERY!!!!!! </span></p>
