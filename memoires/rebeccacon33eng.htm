    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Last night, when I got 
    back to my room, Carmen was already asleep in her bed. The gift I had gotten 
    her was placed on my bed. There was a note attached to the back of it. It 
    read:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight:700">
    Rebecca, You have been so nice to me. You are like the sister I never had 
    and always wanted. But, I have done something very wrong! I want to tell you 
    because I know you, of all people, can help me. But I am afraid you will 
    judge me for my actions. I don't know what to do and I am very afraid! I 
    can't tell Diego for I know he will leave me. If you choose to, meet me in 
    the Japanese Gardens, tomorrow at 2:30 and I will explain everything to you. 
    Please don't tell anyone where you are going. I could get very serious 
    trouble with Braintec. If you don't come I will understand. You may want to 
    think twice if you choose to be involved. Thank you for the monkeys. They 
    did make me smile, but I don't feel I deserve them. <br>
    Carmen&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I can't imagine what 
    this could be about. Is she going to tell me that she is pregnant? Is the 
    baby not Diego's? So many things went racing through my mind. I wanted to 
    wake her up and talk to her. But I knew the best thing would be to wait.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She just sounded so 
    desperate in her letter. I figured I would go see Carmen in the Japanese 
    Gardens at 2:30 and hopefully make it back by 6:00 for the Grand Canyon 
    Uplaod I was supposed to be getting next. If I missed it, Dr. Hamilton would 
    surly want to know where I was. Then he would most likely get Sheila 
    involved. Whatever Carmen is involved in, I will have to keep quiet about 
    it. It sounds serious! So, for Carmen sake, I will have to be back on time.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It is 12:00 now. I 
    will shower then go meet Carmen. What could this be about?</span></p>
