    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I am starting to get 
    everything under control. Rosanne has sent everyone an e-mail to tell that 
    she’s left to Japan. Her belongings are neatly stored in boxes inside the 
    hired container. The most important and valuable things, especially the data 
    of my work here at Braintec are locked up in a safe. I can leave whenever I 
    want. That gives a great feeling. But I don't want to leave yet. I can still 
    improve my software here in the lab before I bring it to Dr. Tachikawa. And 
    besides that, I won't say no to an upload every now and then. I do search 
    them out, I must say. Lately I had one of Sally's. It took place on a 
    fashion parade. It was very exciting and yet so common. That will say: I 
    experienced the upload as very usual, and it felt as if I took place in it, 
    that is quit logical, but the experience to be there was very exciting. 
    Together with approximately ten women on the catwalk. Beneath the huge decor 
    lights, in the pandemonium of the dressing rooms, being stalked by cameras 
    and flashlights. It was an effervescent world. Now I can understand why so 
    many people are caught by the idea of being a model. Directly after the 
    upload the feeling was overwhelming, I was really tired from the tensions 
    and the stress. But now, I find it a bit embarrassing. I feel a bit like a 
    peeper in a world that's actually so closed. But, it were very attractive 
    ladies. </span></p>

    <p><span style="font-family: Arial">I have to get this one thing off my 
    chest. I heard that Hans and Heather have left right after their operation. 
    Not to Japan, because they've never met Kodjiro, but straight out the gate 
    onto the streets. Why this towering fear? Couldn't Sheila of Hamilton 
    foresee this concerning those two? They have been tested as intensive as all 
    the others, haven't they? They seem to suffer from an over scaled fear 
    syndrome. I understand how Sonja's e-mail could start those thoughts, I had 
    them as well, but to run away immediately? I truly don't get the point. That 
    Hans seemed to be a sober-minded Dutch who isn't easy to unsettle. I was 
    probably wrong about that. I hope they'll return. If only for getting the 
    implant removed under the right procedure. What if they keep a permanent 
    failure if some surgeon isn't familiar with the device and starts piddling. 
    In a while these two will live like a couple of zombies. Then Braintec can 
    expect a claim, through which they can shut their gates immediately. </span></p>
