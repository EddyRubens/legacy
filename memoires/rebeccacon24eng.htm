    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen just got back 
    from her upload. She was sort of disappointed. She said that her upload was 
    not exciting at all. I found that very hard to believe. The fact that we are 
    experiencing someone else's memory is exciting enough for me! But I dared 
    not tell her how I really felt. I just sympathized with her as she shared 
    her upload with me.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She said it started 
    off with her in an old cabin. She said it was out in the county on a 
    hillside. She said she felt it was a place where she was comfortable and had 
    spent many afternoons alone. She described the two small rooms and the loft 
    upstairs. It sounded marvelous! But, I just said to her, <i>&quot;How boring!&quot;
    </i><br>
    She said after walking around 'the old fire hazard' (as she was calling it) 
    she went outside into a field of wild flowers. She remembers picking many 
    different kinds and putting them into a basket she had in her arm. She said 
    the only real sensations she felt were, the cool breeze blowing and the 
    aromatic smell of the wild flowers.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I would have been 
    thrilled to experience such peacefulness! But Carmen was clearly unhappy 
    with it. She told me that she asked how come she didn't get the jets like I 
    did. Dr. Hamilton supposedly told her that they randomly select the M-stores 
    for the subjects. But in her case, they decided to choose something calm 
    because of the complications she had during her surgery. Of course that 
    irritated her! I told her, <i>&quot;Don't worry Carm... They'll see that you did 
    fine with this one ... and I know that next time will be more exciting!&quot; </i>
    She gave me sort of a half smile and said, <i>&quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot;</i> </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I told her to call 
    Diego to tell him about it. He has this special ability to always get her 
    smiling. I just hope he doesn't talk her into going home. He has been so on 
    the edge since Carmen's surgery. He has been calling me all the time to ask 
    how she is doing. I finally gave him my email address and told him it was 
    easier if he left me mail.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Please, please, please 
    let Carmen come back smiling! I know she hasn't been too happy lately and I 
    am worried that she will want to leave. I keep telling her it's all new and 
    we just need to take time to get use to things. I don't think Carmen likes 
    change to much. Plus, now that she has experienced what she was desperately 
    waiting for, and it was not what she expected, I feel she might decide her 
    time here is done.&nbsp; Maybe I should call Diego and talk to him. I couldn't 
    stand to be alone here!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton left me a 
    note to come see him.&nbsp; I wonder what this could be about! I will go to his 
    office and see. Maybe when I get back, all will be well with Carmen.</span></p>
