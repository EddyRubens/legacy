    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">From the top of the 
    hill there is a beautiful view to all directions. A lot of bushes, softwoods 
    against the hills and broad-leaved forest beneath. If a glider approaches, 
    we dive in some bushes. We overview where we’ve walked. With some effort we 
    trace the track from the past days. We see movements at the spot where we’ve 
    slept. With sharp vision we see red and white figures. Our sleeping spot</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial"> 
    has been discovered! How is that possible? The only possibility seems to be 
    the laptop. </span><span style="font-family: Arial">So we search for 
    programs that might be into it. Now the laptop seems to registrate all my 
    body functions and movements. Braintec could follow me till Heather pulled 
    the wires out of my body. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">
    Now it is completely disorganized. After fifteen minutes we get the 
    functions back online. </span><span style="font-family: Arial">We arrange it 
    this way that we seem to move to the east. Yes, the misguiding seems to work.
    </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">The red and white figures 
    really go eastbound. We shaked them off for a while. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">How to 
    continue? In the other directions is nothing else than forests. In the 
    distance we see a small plane departing. There has to be an airport. </span>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Is that a way to escape or is Braintec 
    there as well? We just try it. With a compass (I always take that and a 
    knife with me when traveling) we enter the woods. No path, so that goes slow. 
    After two hours plodding we find a sand path heading almost the right 
    direction. After another hour we hear the sound of an engine behind us and we 
    dive in the bushes. It is a Landrover with a trailer for a glider. &nbsp;We are 
    on the right track! The sand path is long. When the evening comes we still 
    can’t see the airport. There is still enough to eat for dinner and we make 
    it comfortable this evening together. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">At five o’clock in the 
    morning we wake up because everything is getting moistly. we took a 
    necessary walk at dawn. The breakfast is our last food. After a four hours 
    walk we hear a small planet flying right above us. The airport can’t be far 
    now. After another hour we suddenly see it through the birches and beeches. 
    Our enthusiasm disappears quickly when we see a red and white car between 
    the small planes. Braintec is too quick for us. We craw towards a hangar and 
    put on some pilot’s clothes we find hanging there, above our own clothes.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">From here we can hear 
    what the Brainteccers are saying. They offer the pilots some money to look 
    for us. One pilot says to a colleague that he finds it too dangerous because 
    he will fly alone and he needs all his concentration for flying. We walk 
    towards him and promise him to search if we may fly with him. He finds that 
    an excellent idea. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After thirty minutes 
    we depart. Heather could buy some provisions in the airport shop. We soon 
    say that we see ‘ourselves’ walking down there. We give the exact locations 
    where we must be according to the laptop. East from the sleeping spot. The 
    pilot passed it on to Braintec through his radio. The response there is 
    enthusiastic because it compares so well to their other data. The pilot has 
    his reward and set course to his destination. &nbsp;</span></p>
