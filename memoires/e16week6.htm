    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was just starting my 
    accompanying tour along the test subjects when Sonja called me to the small 
    kitchen. Her voice sounded enthusiastic which made me curious. <i>“Those 
    test subjects can still wait for a while.”</i> I thought and rushed towards 
    her. On the table there was a huge flower bouquet. <i>“From whom did you get……?”</i> 
    I continued but she shook her head and rapidly gave me this card into my 
    hand. <i>“For me?”</i> My heart began to beat faster. Who was the one who 
    spent so much money for me? Such a bouquet must have cost a fortune! It was 
    my intention to open the cover very carefully but my fingers could not 
    possibly do their work fast and at the same time carefully. So I had torn it 
    into pieces. A card with much red, no doubt it was for Valentine and in this 
    card was a handwritten poem:</span></p>

    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">
    I have somewhere surely <br>
    Lived a life of joy with you, <br>
    All is recall'd as we flit by each other, <br>
    Fluid, affectionate, chaste, matured,</span></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">
  
    It comes to me as a dream<br>
   I am not to speak to you,<br>
    I am to think of you <br>
    when I sit alone or wake at night</span></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">

    But matters not of dreams or real<br>
    It is the way I truly feel<br>
    And deep inside I know of love<br>
    And in the sky and up above</span></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">
    The web of our mind, like azure blue sky<br>
    Upon the water now caught by the eye.<br>
    And stately trees of emerald green<br>
    Echoing their past of things once seen.</span></i></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial">No 
    sender. I turned the card again. Again no sender. Also I could not find a 
    written clue on the pieces left who could have written such a sweet poem. 
    Could it be….? I was afraid to think so but I desperately wished the card 
    came from Kodjiro. <i>“And?”</i> Sonja asked who had been waiting patiently.
    <i>“A very sweet poem, but no sender.”</i> I reached to her the card. <i>
    “Very beautiful.”</i> she sighed. <i>“Who do you think it could be?”</i> 
    Sonja raised her eyebrows. How would she know? Her eyes were glittering. <i>
    “I think you got an admirer, Rosan, how thrilling!”</i> Unfortunately I 
    could not share her excitement. No need for an admirer, I want Kodjiro! I 
    could not imagine that this gift came from him and also Sonja skipped his 
    name. First of all he is much too busy, and secondly I never believe that he 
    cares for those typical American traditions and thirdly… Again I felt that 
    pain in my tummy. Thirdly he would have sent it to Jessica. I put the flower 
    bouquet in the relaxation room. It’s up to them what to do with it.</span></p>
