    <span style="font-family: Arial">Seeing back all the test subjects was a 
    fancy happening. Or should I say: partners in misfortune. We all had some 
    kind of adventures, and we all had a lot to tell. But the biggest adventure 
    was most probably the one of Hans and Heather: they were going to marry! 
    Everyone was busy preparing the ceremony. It was so beautiful, the flowers, 
    Heather in her white dress, Hans overwhelmed by happiness, and dr. Hamilton’s 
    nieces as bridesmaids! Also nice to see Rosanne this way: I have known her 
    as a spicy, tough lady, but during the ceremony she was sniffing as a sick 
    seal... </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">It became a huge party, and we all became 
    more or less drunk. Paul surprised me: he turned out to be a well-trained 
    tango dancer and he whirled me across the dance floor as if I weighted 
    nothing. <i>&quot;Do you have Latin blood or so?&quot;</i> I mumbled tipsy, while I 
    was almost doing the splits. <i>&quot;No,&quot;</i> said Paul, <i>&quot;but I do have red 
    blood!&quot; </i>on which I was brought to pause at the side of the dance floor 
    with a double Axel. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">When it became light 
    again and the birds started to sing we were the only ones left on the dance 
    floor. As in a dream we danced on the sweet-voiced but spend voice of 
    Sinatra. <i>&quot;When I saw you for the first time, I started to believe in 
    faith.”</i> Paul whispered softly in my ear. <i>“I like you too,”</i> I said. 
    And we stood still in a deep hug. There was nothing and nobody else in this 
    world than us. I wished this could go on for ever.</span></p>
