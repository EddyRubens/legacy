    Carmen said first. <i>&quot;Cross my heart!&quot;</i> I said while making a crossing 
    motion on my chest. &nbsp;Kaleb paused for a minute. He was obviously hesitating 
    as to whether or not he was going to tell us something. Then finally he let 
    it out, <i>&quot;I'm here undercover. I work for the CIA. &quot;</i>He went over to 
    his desk and pulled out a black wallet from under some papers. He handed it 
    to me. <i>&quot;Go ahead, open it,&quot;</i> he said. When I opened it, there was a 
    clear plastic casing that held an ID card. It was a CIA ID card. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen was looking 
    over my shoulder and then said, <i>&quot;So, maybe you can tell us what's going 
    on! We need to get out of here! Can you help us?&quot;</i> He looked at her and 
    said, <i>&quot;First let me explain why I'm here.&quot;</i> He motioned for us to have 
    a seat so Carmen and I sat on the bed. He sat at the chair by the desk then 
    continued. <i>&quot;Before I became an agent, I had a twin brother. We went 
    through all the basic training and took all the assigned courses. Then about 
    two weeks before our final exam Kasey, my brother, came across a flier about 
    this place.&quot; </i>He explained how Kasey was immediately interested and 
    decided to join. From what he was saying, Kasey looked into Braintec and 
    came in contact with Dr. Hamilton. He was finally able to persuade Kaleb to 
    join when he mentioned how they would be the first twins to do memory 
    extraction's. The doctors (most likely Dr. Tachikawa) offered Kaleb and 
    Kasey and ridiculous amount of money to come. They also made a huge deal 
    about how they were finally going to get to do 'Twin Extraction's.&quot; In a 'Twin 
    Extraction' the doctors took an extraction of the same memory from each of 
    them. Then they reversed the M-stores and Kaleb and Kasey got each others 
    upload. He continued to say that one night, a few days after the 'Twin 
    Extraction,' Kasey had a scheduled upload. Apparently he never returned to 
    their room that night. They found his lifeless body the next day, in a chair 
    in one of the uploading rooms. No one was sure what happened or why he died.

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He said the facility 
    kept it all under wraps because they didn't want to scare any of the other 
    test subjects away. Then, they made up some story for the 'Newbie's' (That 
    was his term for new test subjects) about how his brother was murdered 
    before Kaleb even came to Braintec. He mentioned how they were nice enough 
    to grant him a few weeks of bereavement and let him leave the state to plan 
    and attend the services. <i>&quot;When I was back home, in North Carolina, I was 
    approached by the agency. They said that because I had the basic training 
    and experience in a facility they wanted to know more about, they were 
    interested in hiring me. Now I am here undercover trying to find out what 
    happened to my brother and trying to nail Tachikawa.&quot; </i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I told him how in the 
    first email I received, there was mention that the CIA was not even sure 
    that Dr. Tachikawa or any of the other doctor or scientists here, were the 
    man they were looking for. Kaleb said that when Dr. Tachikawa worked for the 
    CIA, he was using his given birth name, Shinicho Matsushita. It was on his 
    birth certificate and other legal documents in his CIA employment files. 
    Once he was terminated, he quickly and legally changed his name to Kodjiro 
    Tachikawa. It threw off the CIA for a few months. They were looking for him 
    under his birth name. <i>&quot;Once we figured out his new name, we were sure 
    that he was, and is, the guy we're after.&quot; &quot;So, do you think that he might 
    have something to do with your brother's death?&quot;</i> I asked. <i>&quot;If I 
    didn't think the bastard was responsible, I wouldn't have come back!&quot;</i> he 
    said.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He went on to tell us 
    that if we wanted to help, the only thing we could do was pretend like 
    nothing was going on. <i>&quot;Don't miss any uploads or they will know 
    something's up,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;They know how addictive these uploads are, 
    and if you refuse to have them they'll either send you to Sheila and Lucas 
    to be hypnotized, or they'll lock you up in the East Wing until your ready 
    to talk.&quot; &quot;The East Wing! That's where they have our friend Megan!&quot;</i> I 
    told him. <i>&quot;She emailed me and told me that Dr. Tachikawa was planning 
    some sort of experimental extraction later on today. We were trying to think 
    of a way for her to get out of it! Do you think you can help?&quot; &quot;I'll see 
    what I can do,&quot;</i> he replied. <i>&quot;I want the two of you to stay together 
    as much as possible! Don't be alone with any of these doctors under any 
    circumstance. Make up any excuse. I'll look into getting your friend out of 
    there before her extraction.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We let him know what 
    time our uploads were and when Megan's extraction was. He told us to do this 
    one last time, then go have dinner as scheduled with the agents. (He already 
    knew about the dinner plan.) He said that the agents would do what they 
    could to get us out of there, and get Tachikawa for good.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
