    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I was almost bursting 
    with impatience to upload another memory after the Grand Canyon experience. 
    It was my plan not to force anything and just let it come naturally. The 
    recall was nice, but not as nice as the previous one. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">I was in a garden. A 
    manicured garden with a good smell and a lot of flowers. I felt convenient</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial"> 
    here. The grass has been mowed and smelled delicious. Some birds were 
    picking the blades. I was very proud of this garden. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">Did men realize how hard I had worked on 
    this? It is not that easy to get these plants so full of flowers. Now that 
    the rhododendrons were in full bloom, I got a good run for my work. The 
    flowers were shining gloriously and made me smile. I touched one of the 
    flowers carefully. Its red was as soft as velvet and it lost some pollen. 
    After I walked a bit across the path I started to search for the rake. It 
    was time to rake the loose grass blades together. </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">After this recall I 
    wished for one moment that I had my own garden as well. It should be nice to 
    dig in the earth and to see what the seasons do. But my garden would never 
    be so well organized and full of flowers. I prefer a more wildly world and I 
    would probably neglect my garden quite soon. Let nature do its work, then I 
    shall do mine. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Writing a
