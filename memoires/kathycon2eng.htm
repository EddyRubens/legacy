    first two nights were like a hostel but now it is different. It is work but 
    it isn’t, you know what I mean? Most of the people are very kind to me.

    She isn’t doing anything wrong... </span>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">This morning Sally asked me 
    if I could have a word with Steve about it. Asking if he wants to go out 
    with her. I disagreed. I have learned from another situation that it’s not 
    always good to follow your instinct. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial;color:black">But Sally kept pushing.
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Therefor I suggested 
    to ask Michael as well and go with the four of us. To the movies or so. She 
    agreed with my proposal and now I’m going to email the boys. </span></p>

    real upload tomorrow and I am a bit afraid that it is going to be 
    overwhelming. I already had some minor things uploaded, the clock and a vase, 
    but they say I’m now ready for the real memories. And those small 
    impressions were already so overwhelming!</span></p>
