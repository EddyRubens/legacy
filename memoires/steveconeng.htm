    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Finally I’m ready to get my diary 
    online as well. It took me some extra time because I didn’t know how I 
    wanted to present myself. And if I do something, I want it to have my full 
    attention. Here it is:</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">My name is Steve and I study 
    psychology at the University of Seattle. My expertise is memories, so you 
    understand that I’m at the right place at Braintec. I learn so much about 
    experiencing memories and I have more than enough time left to prepare for 
    my exams. I want to graduate next spring. Most of the students learn for 
    their exams at home. I prefer this, I learn more and even get paid for it. 
    My dearest wish is to have my own practice and to develop some sophisticated 
    research on the changing of memories. Most memories aren’t similar to the 
    original moment. Our memories seem to adapt every now and then and resemble 
    what we prefer. Why can we perfectly conserve cognitive information and why 
    do we change emotional information? That’s what I am going to find out!</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Unfortunately I couldn’t get a MESI. 
    I have a natural fear for hypnosis. It’s a pity that no one can recall my 
    memories, I’ve got some very good ones. It would be so great to know how 
    someone else experiences my memories. But you can’t get it all. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">If possible, I want to ask other 
    test subjects some questions about their recalls. It would be perfect for my 
    thesis if I map the differences. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The first weeks I had a room for 
    myself and now I have to share it. Now I share my room with a Dutch guy 
    called Michael. He seems to be okay but he wants to listen to The Cure all 
    the time. Sorry Michael if you read this, but I hate that. It irritates me. 
    Yesterday I asked him to put on the headphones. I am glad he did, I was 
    trying to study. One of these days I’ll put on some Linkin Park to teach 
    him some real music. </font></p>
