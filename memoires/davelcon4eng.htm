    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It's horrible here, 
    and what is worse, it is&nbsp; not supposed to be.&nbsp; Something went wrong in the 
    surgery, I think, like, maybe they left a special canister or capsule of 
    hallucinogenic medicine in my system?&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that what is happening is 
    that there is something left over in my system that was not supposed to be 
    there, something that is penetrating my conscience and my consciousness, and 
    making me vulnerable to things I should not see.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The world should be a 
    happy interface, where I am able to confront that which pleases me.&nbsp; Others 
    seem to be pleased at their lives.&nbsp; I envy Rosanna, who is often wooed by 
    the doctors, or by other subjects, because of her happy, yet pensively 
    objective, subjectivity.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Today I had a nice 
    meal, one of the first meals I have been able to cook myself without 
    becoming distracted by images and visions.&nbsp; Maybe I am the healer here, the 
    medicine man who can see into the beyond? I don't know, nor do I care right 
    now.&nbsp; I am able over the past eighteen hours to enjoy my tofu, mybeans, some 
    brocolli and ketchup and h ot sauce.&nbsp; I love to pour condiments on 
    everything.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When will I find out 
    what has happened?&nbsp; Will someone, a doctor, email me to suggest what is the 
    discrepancy? I want a normal life without this post traumatic stress, this 
    anxiety about my future.&nbsp; The ironic thing is that this haunting, fragmented 
    past is not mine.&nbsp; Could this be the instigation of a belief in 
    primogeniture or re-incarnation?&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">One day i would like 
    to go to India.&nbsp; I was in love with a Sikh girl once, I remember her, 
    Taschda.&nbsp; She was unique in so many ways.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I will finish my meal
