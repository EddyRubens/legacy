    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I really enjoyed 
    searching for the sender of my Valentine’s present. Sonja and I were 
    behaving like two hilarious teenagers and that was sure a relief. Our idea 
    with Robbert’s card was exactly the way we wanted it to happen. We did not 
    find a handwriting resembling the poem. But that did not spoil our pleasure. 
    It was Robbert himself who queered somebody’s pitch. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Just 
    like Dr. Hamilton told me already a few days ago Robbert returned to do some 
    more tests. Happy and cheerful he walked into the communion-room where we 
    were watching TV with roughly eight people at the time. Felt deadly ashamed! 
    Everybody could see that he was in high spirits far from depressive. Steve 
    investigated about it and so he replied that he had not felt better ever 
    before. He and his wife have had discussions during some nights and together 
    they realized that it was much too early to get separated. By recalling 
    somebody’s memories Robbert felt he could easily imagine other people’s 
    feelings. He explained that he understands his wife much better now. Even 
    plans had been made to make their honeymoon-trip over again within two 
    months. Together for just one week in Egypt. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">While Robbert told us 
    this, many glances pointed my direction. I did not know how to look back. 
    Sonja was in session at that moment so I was desperately left on my own. 
    There was no excuse anymore then to get the card. Denying the whole matter 
    just like that would be ridiculous. So I collected the giga-card. <i>“Good 
    to hear that you are doing fine in the meantime!” </i>&nbsp;I said while I was 
    ready to give him the card. <i>“We all have written you something wishing 
    you all the best for the future. I realize now that it is not necessary 
    anymore. Glad for you. I will give it to you anyway. On behalf of all test 
    subjects of Braintec.”</i> It was very clear that Robbert did not understand 
    what to do with this card. However he thanked us kindly and his eyes rushed 
    over the texts quickly. Then it was time for him to do some tests. I 
    accompanied him up to the laboratory like he could not manage without any 
    escort. It seemed to me the easiest way to avoid possible questions of other 
    test subjects.</span></p>
