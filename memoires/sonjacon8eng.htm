    <span style="font-family: Arial">At night, around three o’clock, I went to 
    Tachikawa’s condominium. &nbsp;The number and the name matched, but the building 
    was electronically secured. And the apartment was at the highest but one 
    floor. An old man in a blue-grey uniform was mobbing the floor in the lobby. 
    I tapped at the thick glass of the entrance doors and beckoned him. He 
    tiredly went to me dragging his feet. He didn’t speak English, and I had to 
    use my hands and feet to tell him I made an appointment with someone at 
    number 374 (the apartment next to Tachikawa’s), but my flight was delayed, 
    and now no one was answering the door – and so on. Ha! Little security: the 
    man opened the door and gave me a plastic key, probably some kind of 
    skeleton key. I took the elevator to go upstairs, it took a long time, and I 
    felt my heart in my throat. What am I to do? Upstairs I sneaked through the 
    corridor and listened at the apartment next to Tachikawa’s. I couldn’t hear 
    a thing. I softly but urgently knocked at the door. Still nothing. 
    Resolutely I moved the card through the lock and the door clicked open 
    hardly making any sound.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It was dark. I almost 
    stumbled over some bags in the hallway. I walked trough the apartment to the 
    window site – there was nobody home, I was lucky. I had to regain my breath 
    to calm down – my head was glowing of adrenaline. Softly I opened the door 
    to the sun roof. A cold wind blew inside and I got strangled in the long 
    lace curtain which blew inside. On my toes I headed the wall separating the 
    two terraces. The wall was approximately two meters high, but I used a chair 
    to watch over it, to Tachikawa’s apartment. Immediately I pulled back my 
    head: I watched directly into his illuminated sleeping room! Then I realized 
    they could impossibly see me while it was still dark outside, and I 
    carefully reached my head above the wall. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I saw Dr. Tachikawa 
    talking to a grey, tall shape. He made suggestions and looked angry. Then 
    the other man turned round to pick up an attaché case and I immediately 
    recognized him: it was the same man I saw in the English cottage from where 
    I escaped! &nbsp;Who spoke so lovingly about his (???) 'Project for a New Global 
    Order'... At the back of the room was a beautifully painted Japanese folding 
    screen, and behind that I could see a bed, a Japanese futon on the ground. 
    Someone was sleeping on it. It seemed to be woman. I climbed from the chair 
    and moved it towards the other side of the sun roof, to get a better view on 
    the bed. It was a woman indeed. A beautiful young woman sleeping with a 
    happy smile on her face. And I knew this woman. It was ... Rosanne. </span>
