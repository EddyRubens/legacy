    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The second day was 
    filled with several tests. Funny to make but without unexpected results. 
    Happily I’m healthy, flexible and capable of dealing with stress. The 
    brainscan made some funny graphics. There is nothing to see from the eye 
    operation I had recently. According to the doctor this was a positive sign. 
    I can undergo the operation without problems. The doctor tried to convince 
    me to undergo the MESI-operation. It was a bit harder, but the tests made 
    clear that I’m very suitable for it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">After the test I wanted 
    to have a walk outside the territory. They made it difficult. It was 
    dangerous, I definitely had to be back on time and more of that. After a lot 
    of pressure I was free to go. It is lovely spring. The other companies have 
    gardens as well. And the neighbourhood further on the road is also green. No 
    other hikers, only passing cars. Some looked a bit strange at me. I assume 
    walking isn’t a regular way to spend your time. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I’m back at lunch with 
    the two Japanese and one American woman. She says that one of the other two 
    women got sick during the test. At diner I hear from the second American 
    woman that her friend went insane during the tests and that she is sent home 
    immediately. She doubts if she still wants to go on.</span></p>
