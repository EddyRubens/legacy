    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Aha, 
    I’m one of the 14%! The hypnosis I underwent during this afternoon’s session 
    was nothing like the public amusement I witnessed as a child. I have to say 
    that the hypnotist does have the type of face that could get him a role in a 
    David Lynch movie. And he acted so friendly it made me jittery. He pasted a 
    blue dot on the white wall in front of me and told me to concentrate on it. 
    Meanwhile he spoke in a very relaxed manner. What happened from then on I 
    can’t exactly remember. So that’s how easy it is to get me to dive into my 
    subconscious! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">So it’s going to be a 
    MESI-implant. They didn’t need to discuss it for very long. The director, 
    Dr. Hamilton made it clear that this afternoon’s session with the hypnotist 
    made for an easy decision. He was beaming with satisfaction when he entered 
    my room as I was getting my stuff together for the next move. <i>
    “Congratulations!”</i> he exclaimed jovially as he shook my hand. <i>“You 
    are a golden girl.”</i> Then he explained that the duration of this 
    operation wouldn’t be much longer than anticipated and the recuperation 
    period would only take two or three days more. The added possibilities 
    however, appear to be enormous. Only with a MESI will it be possible to 
    extract memories from the brain, so with a MESI you can also relive your own 
    moments. Many a subject is much harder to hypnotize so many of them would 
    like to be in my shoes. Maybe even be jealous. Besides, as Dr. Hamilton 
    subtly added, subjects with a MESI-implant get more compensation. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    would have been quite impudent to resist such convincing arguments. The 
    choice was already made for me and I had no trouble accepting that. A MESI 
    it is, tomorrow morning. </span></p>
