    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Today I had an 
    appointment with Sonja sharing lunch together in the Japanese garden. We 
    stopped on our way to buy some bagels. Some time later we were having a good 
    feed on “our” bench. I really did miss these bagels! We started talking, 
    actually about nothing, until I saw the owner of the park. <i>“Mr. Soesasji!”</i> 
    I shouted at him. He waved at us and walked towards us. The last time I had 
    dinner with Dr. Tachikawa in the Ryoko, Mr. Soesasji joined us at our table. 
    He and Dr. Tachikawa have been good friends for years now. He is a funny man 
    who speaks English in a beautiful way. <i>“Hey Rosanne,”</i> he said shaking 
    my hand strongly and bending himself in front of me. I bowed a bit further 
    down showing my appreciation for his higher status. <i>“This is Sonja. Sonja 
    Boutoille.”</i> He also shook hands with Sonja. <i>“Pleased to meet you.”</i> 
    Sonja answered very politely. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“Boutoille,”</span></i></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><b> 
    the man mumbled. <i>“that name does not mean anything.”</i> He seemed to dig 
    into his memory but did not find anything. We talked about the weather, 
    about Braintec of course and the fact that I just returned from Holland. 
    Sonja’s native country Belgium came into the picture too. Then suddenly a 
    sparkling light started burning inside Mr. Soesasji’s head. <i>“You mean 
    Hugo Boutoille?”</i> Sonja’s face turned pale. This Japanese seemed to know 
    her husband! <i>“Yes, yes,”</i> he stuttered. <i>“How is he now?”</i> Mr. 
    Soesasji asked. Impossible for Sonja to answer this question. And not only 
    because she did not have the slightest idea how Hugo was doing. It was very 
    obvious that her throat was blocked. Mr. Soesasji also discovered this. He 
    looked at me frightened. <i>“Did I say anything wrong?”</i> I read into his 
    eyes. <i>“How do you know Sonja’s husband?”</i> I asked to disrupt silence.
    <i>“Ah, a few weeks ago he was here with Kodjiro. We spent the whole evening 
    together and became very drunk.”</i> Sonja was totally shocked. <i>“Your 
    husband is a very easy-going person.”</i> he added into her direction, in 
    order to make Sonja at ease. This all was too much for Sonja. She walked 
    away in complete shock without saying anything. I shook hands with Mr. 
    Soesasji and ran after her. Tears were running along her cheeks in silence. 
    We did not say a word; instead we sat down along the waterside. I put an arm 
    around her shoulder and gave her my handkerchief.&nbsp;</b> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">The same 
    afternoon we did not return to the Research Centre. We paced up and down 
    town and went to the movies. It was a stupid Hollywood movie, but there 
    wasn’t anything else to see. Actually I had to be given an upload this 
    afternoon. I regret I missed it. In the meantime it has been a long time 
    since I was really looking forward to it. But this afternoon Sonja needed me 
    and that’s also very important. </span></p>
