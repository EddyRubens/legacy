    <span style="font-family: Arial">Obviously I was making it all up, but 
    I felt very pleased with my slyness. The Canadian and Tachikawa looked at 
    each other another time. <i>“Don’t ask me why,”</i> Tachikawa said, <i>&quot;but 
    you seem to be quit reliable. But what I don’t understand, is why you bother 
    so much for wrapping into Braintec’s business.”</i> I assumed he would be 
    very dumb if I could guess why: <i>&quot;Well, doc, I am disappointed in you.&quot;</i> 
    Tachikawa’s hurtled proud pissed him off, and he became red, but the 
    Canadian calmed him down with a soothing gesture and he headed, apparently 
    interested, to me: <i>&quot;Tell me.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">I explained to him, how my kidnapping made 
    clear to me that Hugo (“my ex,” I added quit indifferently) worked for 
    Braintec. And how I emptied his bank account in Brussels (that they found 
    rather amusing). And how I started to use ‘my mind’ by then: Braintec is, if 
    you play it the right way, a good opportunity to make a lot of money in a 
    short period of time, <i>“just like your stake in this business,”</i> I 
    added. The Canadian smiled, and placed the ‘upload’ back in his suitcase. He 
    was probably convinced. Tachikawa wasn’t yet, but I understood he wasn’t the 
    one to decide.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">We drank our tea. After some time to think, 
    the Canadian said: <i>“All right. I will make a contract for you. You have 
    proved yourself an excellent informer and we can use you well. Because we 
    have a huge problem with the test subjects in </i></span><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Portland, as you already might know. We 
    have deliberately chosen the most instable persons for our experiments, but 
    they turned out to be more stabile than we thought...&quot;</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    The Canadian stroke his knee worriedly. <i>“Of course Rosanne is the spill 
    of this all,”</i> – he nodded towards the sleeping room again – <i>“and we 
    can’t keep her under control with these addictive uploads forever…” </i>Ah, 
    so that is how things go, I thought. The Canadian went on<i>: “But before we 
    can give you a contract, you must prove your servitude to the PNGO. I hereby 
    give you the order to eliminate Rosanne. But we can’t have any blood on our 
    hands for the moment, so I leave it up to you and your intelligence and 
    imagination how to execute.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Shortly: I was in. I went 
    back to my guestroom to get some sleep and to devise a plan. Of course I had 
    to get in touch with that poor Rosanne, who had no idea what was hanging 
    above her head. I called Tachikawa, who said he had sent Rosanne to town for 
    some errands, and I took a taxi immediately towards the concerning shop, and 
    waited for her in an alley. I showed her a picture of the Canadian, and she 
    told me she had seen him at the Braintec office here in Tokyo. The office 
    was inside a blood bank. She gave me the address and offered me some money 
    with it. The poor child, how could she know. I let her go, this time: the 
    less she knew the better. And I needed time to decide how to “get rid of” 
    Rosanne… First of all I should visit the so-called blood bank.</span></p>
