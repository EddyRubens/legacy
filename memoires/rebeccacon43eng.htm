    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I still feel extremely 
    exhausted. Yesterdays ordeal with Dr. Tachikawa and Dr. Hamilton still has 
    me in a state of shock. I thought an extraction's were a calm and relaxing 
    experience, when you get hypnotized and brought back to a specific time. ( 
    That's what I was told anyway!)</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">They obviously choose 
    to do things different with me. I can only wonder if they used such tactics 
    with any of the other test subjects. Maybe this is why Kathy flipped out. I 
    wonder how many visits to the 'Chamber' she might have had. Makes me think, 
    would she have mentioned anything to Sally. I will try to talk with her 
    later. She might be able to shed some light on things. I am also wondering 
    why they were so intent to get a fear extraction with my Automatonophobia, 
    when earlier they seemed more interested in my fear of bees? I just want to 
    forget that terrible day!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;When Carmen returned 
    from getting dinner last night, she brought back some Cheeseburgers, French 
    Fries and Milk Shakes. She said something about how she was 'craving' it. I 
    smiled, but I truly felt sorry for the little baby inside her. The poor 
    thing had an MESI implant in it's head. I sure hope it can be successfully 
    removed without harming it in any way.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I shared last nights 
    event with Carmen and she said that things were getting way out of hand and 
    we needed to hurry and find a way out. <i>&quot; I couldn't agree more!&quot;</i> I 
    said.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We never did get a 
    chance to look online about the CIA letter I received. We planned to do some 
    research when I return from the Japanese Gardens. I am supposed to meet with 
    Megan today. I should get going. I will have Carmen promise </span>
