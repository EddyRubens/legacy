    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It would be entirely 
    too easy to just assume that someone else's memories have been poured into 
    my body, by virtue of some cosmogenically altered gene soup of a mixture.&nbsp; 
    That's not what science is all about.&nbsp; Science is about selection, choices, 
    making and isolating.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that what has happened is something 
    more complicated.&nbsp; It has caused in me a bellyache of a time, really.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I went for walk over 
    the weekend, on Sunday.&nbsp; It was the first brilliant day&nbsp;I had seen in this 
    dark northern wasteland.&nbsp; I walked past the rock garden, nobody there.&nbsp; I 
    walked through the stand of elms, barren without their leaves.&nbsp; I took a 
    leak against a dark rotting tree.&nbsp; What type it was was of no concern to 
    me.&nbsp; </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Then I sat down and 
    had an experience.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I am calling 
    these moments &quot;seizures of past lives&quot; because I can only see them as that.&nbsp; 
    they are so unusual.&nbsp; In real life I was sitting down on the cold ground, 
    the winter light was radiatiing through the dead pussy willow stems, and 
    some blackbirds were calling in the field behind me.&nbsp; But in my head, as 
    soon as I closed my eyes I was transported.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was never in the field.&nbsp; I 
    was never given to believe that I had ever been in any field.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">This whole 
    time I have been brainwashed, it seems, and the cold of morning, and the 
    walk in the field on Sunday was some kind of medicine induced hypnotism.&nbsp; I 
    feel like I&quot;m breaking apart.&nbsp; Someone is brainwashing me to keep me from 
    realizing that where I really am is a Caribbean island, far away from the 
    United States.</span></p>
