    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    desperately needed an upload. After brushing my teeth I couldn’t get away 
    from the mirror. I kept on staring at my reflection and didn’t like it at 
    all. I hardly recognized myself. Was that really me? Those features, those 
    eyes. Seemed they belong to somebody else. They anxiously stared at me.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I must have a new 
    upload. If necessary, one of my own. I don’t mind a memory I have gone 
    through before either. As long as I can feel that stream of information for 
    just another time. Those two seconds in which the memory enters are highly 
    intensified. All details and emotions involved create a fantastic experience. 
    The feeling of being somebody else and experiencing the world in a different 
    way is absolutely addictive. It was obvious to me earlier. Although such 
    strong withdrawal symptoms are new to me. Or probably caused by neuroleptics? 
    I haven’t taken them for a couple of days.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    urge getting a new upload had become so strong that I had to admit it. If I 
    had asked for it, they would surely have refused it to me. So now I had to 
    do it secretly. First thing, I searched Steward’s room. M-Stores were surely 
    there, but I couldn’t find them. Then I came up with the idea that Adrian 
    also has M-Stores to test his instrument. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian was working 
    hard in his small musty office. He didn’t shave for at least one week. Did 
    he leave this space at all? I opened a window to get some fresh air. <i>
    “Weather is way too beautiful for staying in whole day,”</i> I told Adrian.
    <i>“Yes, yeah, I know,”</i> he muttered frustrated. Things didn’t work out. 
    He turned the switches and looked a bit confused. <i>“What was it, you 
    wanted to know?”</i> he asked. <i>“I was wondering if you could help me,”</i> 
    I made it up, right there. <i>“Maybe you need a test subject?”</i> Adrian 
    looked at me doubtfully. <i>“Do you really think we should do that? After 
    the event in the coffee-room I have doubts about your health.” “Nothing 
    wrong with my health,”</i> I lied<i>. “I only find it hard, now that Kodjiro 
    is not here anymore.”</i> Adrian nodded. <i>“In that case it will be even 
    better. I would like to test something, with just a simple upload.”</i> I 
    was jumping of joy and couldn’t help showing my enthusiasm. <i>“Fine,”</i> I 
    answered acting as normal as possible. <i>“Let’s do it right away.”</i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    sure was a trivial memory. Something like sitting in the sun, a memory I 
    have experienced before. One of my first uploads and despite the soberness 
    of this memory it impressed me exactly when I had it for the first time. 
    Again I felt great. Adrian asked me to stay for just a second and after 
    about fifteen minutes he was as happy as I was. Between the snows of his 
    monitor you could clearly recognize the bright light of the sun.</span></p>
