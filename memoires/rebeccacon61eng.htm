    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The Agents arranged 
    for two private tables. Josh and I were at one of them and Carmen and Diego 
    were at the other. Josh reached his hands across the table and held my 
    hands. I wanted to start crying because I felt like I had let him down 
    somehow. All I could manage to say at first was, <i>&quot;Josh... I'm so sorry!&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Then I did start to 
    cry. He squeezed my hands and said, <i>&quot;Honey, what's done is done. Let's 
    just try to fix whatever is happening. I want you to come home.&quot; </i>I knew 
    then that I could tell Josh everything that has happened and he would do 
    whatever he could to help make it right. I did my best to fit in the past 
    few months into a half hour conversation. I told him everything about Dr. 
    Hamilton, Sheila, Carmen, Megan, Kaleb, Kasey, and the mean Dr. Tachikawa. I 
    told him about the uploads the extraction, Kathy freaking out, how I think 
    they messed up on Davel; and all the crazy things he has done, Dr. 
    Hamilton's diamond bracelet, and everything else I could think of. I could 
    tell by the look on his face that he was overwhelmed with information. He 
    said that he wished that I had emailed him when all this was happening. <i>
    &quot;I could have helped you so much sooner!&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;Josh,...&quot;</i> I 
    said. <i>&quot;You don't understand. I was worried that you would be angry with 
    me for getting involved in something like this. Then, when I decided I would 
    write you about this place, bad things happened. I was afraid that if I 
    involved you, something bad might happen to you. You don't know what Dr. 
    Tachikawa is like. You don't know what he is capable of! I would never 
    forgive myself if something bad happened to you Josh, never!&quot; &quot;We're going 
    to make things right.&quot; </i>Josh said.&nbsp; <i>&quot;I'm going to do whatever it takes 
    to catch this bastard and make sure he's locked up forever. Your my girl, 
    and no one messes with my girl!&quot; </i>He was starting to get mad. I told him 
    that getting angry was not going to help things. He agreed and told me I was 
    right, but I could see he was still boiling inside.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Agent Andrews came 
    over to the table and told us to wrap things up. We both stood up and hugged. 
    I didn't want him to let go. I felt so safe in his arms, but it had to end. 
    Before he walked away, I made him promise not to tell Diego anything I told 
    him. <i>&quot;I don't know how much Carmen is going to tell him.&quot;</i> I said. <i>
    &quot;He needs to find things out from her when she's ready...okay?&quot;</i> He 
    smiled and said, <i>&quot;Anything for you.&quot;</i> He gave me short but sweet kiss 
    and left with Diego and the third Agent.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As I stood watching 
    them walk out, Carmen came up and put her hand on my shoulder. She said, <i>
    &quot;I have a feeling that things are going to be OK.&quot;</i> I looked at her and 
    smiled. I knew there was a long road still ahead, I just wasn't sure if it 
    would be smooth or bumpy.</span></p>
