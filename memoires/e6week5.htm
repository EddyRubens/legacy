    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">It’s strange, this 
    memory of a hike that I’ve never taken part in. And I felt real affection 
    for two people that I have never met my entire life. That’s so bizarre. 
    While reading a book or watching a movie you can sometimes get the feeling 
    that you know the principal characters. But that feeling is by no means as 
    intense as this. Suddenly, all at once I knew these people. From one moment 
    to the next I knew quite a lot about them. That’s bizarre. It fascinates me 
    no end. I’m terribly excited about all this and I’m really looking forward 
    to the next upload. </span></p>
   
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">At the same time I’m a 
    bit worried about my privacy. I have a MESI-implant and I’m sure it won’t be 
    long before my memories will be extracted. Other test subjects will have 
    those uploaded and who knows how much they will get to know about me and my 
    life. Maybe more than I would like them to know. Luckily there isn’t much 
    that I’m ashamed of and that I absolutely wouldn’t want others to know 
    about. But still, some things should not be shared with just anyone. In what 
    way could I protect myself against this sort of invasion of privacy? How 
    much will I be able to keep to myself?</span></p>
