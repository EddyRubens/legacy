    Kodjiro is a fantastic man. We drank tea in his apartment, a beautiful place 
    in the middle of town. I can stay there as long as I want to. Tokyo seems 
    much more friendly now. I just cannot imagine I would have regretted 
    traveling all the way to this place.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Tachikawa was 
    surprised I managed to find him. <i>“You should have become a detective!”</i> 
    he smiled. Braintec has no official office yet here. I was dead lucky I ran 
    into that doctor at the blood bank. <i>“There are hardly any people in </i>
    </span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">Tokyo who know what we’re really 
    doing,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> Kodjiro explained. <i>
    “He might be one out of ten.”</i>&nbsp; It looks as if I will meet him more often.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I had finished my 
    tea, I stood up in order to look out of the window. The apartment was 
    overlooking the town. Kodjiro was standing behind me. Softly he caressed my 
    neck. <i>“I’m glad you came,”</i> he whispered. <i>“Is there something you 
    would like to have?”</i> I turned around suddenly. <i>“An upload!”</i> I 
    called out. I didn’t have an upload for days. After a day or two I only long 
    for nothing else. Kodjiro started laughing. <i>“You will get that for sure!”</i> 
    he said. <i>“Walk with me…”</i> I followed Kodjiro to his bedroom. He had 
    this very low bed, just like a mattress on the floor. He made clear to me I 
    should take place on the bed. He took some equipment out of his bag. A 
    portable charger and a small box of M-Stores. These were decorated with 
    funny pictures. So that’s the way Japanese like it. <i>“An upload for Otemba,”</i> 
    he muttered and before I knew the memory was shooting through my head.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>I was in a big 
    carousel. Everything was moving and turning around me and still I didn’t 
    feel nauseous. It was different from the feeling I felt in my stomach. I was 
    in love! Oh yes, I felt so happy and my love was sitting next to me. So 
    close to me, hidden as if she was scared of all turning movements. I felt so 
    proud. This was my girlfriend! Yuki was her name, yes Yuki. I called out her 
    name and she looked at me. How wonderful eyes! Her straight black hair fit 
    in with her fragile face. Her lips opened halfway then followed by my mouth 
    pressing hers. It reminded me of cherries and a pasture full of spring 
    flowers. We kissed passionately. I was longing for more. It all went too 
    fast. The carousel was turning into all directions and meanwhile my right 
    hand did the same. I pressed the warm body close to mine. The carousel 
    stopped slowly and the memory was over. I was laying spread out on my bed. I 
    felt as if I had an orgasm. Heavenly!&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
