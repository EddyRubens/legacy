    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I woke up this 
    morning the first thing on my mind was: “Upload-day”. Or was I already 
    dreaming about it before I woke up? The second thing I realized was my 
    terrible sickness. I jumped out of bed and discovered I was very dizzy. I 
    had to sit down quickly. I crawled on my knees to the bathroom, where I 
    vomited all what was bothering me in a huge gulf. Sweating and 
    hyperventilating I sat on the ground beside the lavatory bowl. Oh no, my 
    head was hurting me so much, I couldn’t look up. Crawling back to my bed I 
    saw on the alarm clock that it was still very early. Quarter pas six. I was 
    scheduled for the upload at half past nine. Fortunately I’ve got some time. 
    The way I’m feeling now, I have to forget about the whole session. If you’re 
    sick or have some other vague illness, the upload is always canceled. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I have to do something. 
    I must feel better soon. How did I get so nauseous. I haven’t drunk more 
    than those two glasses of white wine during lunch with Hamilton. So it can’t 
    be a hangover. Was it the food? I wish I had chosen the children’s menu, in 
    spite of all those unusual titbits of raw fish and crustaceans. I am very 
    fond of it and I never had any problems with it before. But that is wise 
    talk afterwards. After thirty minutes I carefully rose up on my feet and 
    went back to the bathroom. </span></p>

        in small nips. I filled an empty bottle with water and crawled back in 
        bed with the bottle. Again everything came out, then I felt a lot better. 
        Funny, if you look through the bottle to the label it says “naive”. 
        Maybe that’s what I am. And because of that I lay here, far from home 
        and being a bit sick. It became half past eight. I had to go out. Taking 
        a shower and an aspirin. Then it will be fine for today. </span></td>

    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sheila and Steward 
    were already waiting for me. Sheila looked at me in terror. <i>“You are 
    looking terrible, are you feeling alright?” “I guess I went to sleep a bit 
    too late yesterday. I had such a good book.”</i> I lied. <i>“Besides all 
    those uploads you are reading books as well? Are you ever here, on this 
    world, or are you drifting between fiction and uploads for twenty-four hours 
    a day?”</i> I couldn’t let that happen to me: <i>“If you would know me any 
    better you will say something else. I have almost killed myself working that 
    hard on the DOSS machine during the past weeks.” </i>I retorted sharply. <i>
    “Sorry, that’s not how I meant it, I was just kidding Adrian”. “Okay, sorry 
    as well then. Shall we start?” </i>Steward started to connect the equipment. 
    I was lying myself cozily on the sofa, so the upload could start. Just 
    before I dreamt away Sheila laid her cold hand on my bare forehead.<i> “She 
    can be nice as well.”</i> I thought, just before going to dreamland. </span>
