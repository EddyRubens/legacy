    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I got back to my 
    room, Carmen was already in the shower. I grabbed the phone and called the 
    number Agent Andrews gave me if there was trouble. After I dialed the number 
    I got a busy signal. 'Great,' I thought. 'If someone were trying to kill me 
    I would be getting a busy signal.' I pulled out my laptop and emailed the 
    CIA address where I had reached Agent Andrews before. I mentioned everything 
    that has just happened and said it was urgent that he responded back as soon 
    as possible. I wrote the 'subject title' as...Tachikawa on the Run! 
    Hopefully Agent Andrews will get the message soon. I figured since I had my 
    laptop out, I would write a quick email to the address Megan gave me to her 
    family. If the Agents are not worried enough to help find her, I know her 
    family will. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The letter read as 
    follows:<br>
    <i>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Isakova,</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">
    You are probably wondering who I am and why I am writing you. My name is 
    Rebecca and I am a friend of your daughter, Megan. Megan, as well as myself, 
    have gotten involved with a company which deals with memory recall. It 
    involves a small implant in the brain allowing people to relive their own 
    memories as well as experience the memories of others. It's all very 
    complicated. The reason I am writing to you is because Megan is in serious 
    danger. There is a very horrible doctor here who has been abusive to Megan. 
    He has kept her in solitaire and is trying to make her reveal memories of 
    her father. He is very interested in the KGB and wants to know many 
    specifics, which Megan does not know. When I went to help her leave this 
    place yesterday, she was gone. All of her belonging are gone as well. No one 
    seems to know where she is and I am very worried about her. She gave me your 
    address in secret and pleaded for me to contact you if anything went wrong. 
    I am writing to you for your help because I don't know who else to turn to. 
    Please respond to my email address at anytime.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">
    Regards, Rebecca</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Once I finished the 
    email to Megan's parents, Carmen came out of the bathroom. She looked at me 
    and asked what was wrong. I told her about Dr. Tachikawa leaving and how Dr. 
    Hamilton seemed to be covering it all up. I also told her that I called the 
    Agents, but got a busy signal, so I left them an email. <i>&quot;Well,&quot; </i>She 
    said. <i>&quot;There's nothing we can do now but wait.&quot;</i></span></p>
