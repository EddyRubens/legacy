	<span style="font-family:Arial">As I was waiting for a response from Josh, I 
	received a strange email from a woman named Sonja. She used to be a test 
	subject here until she disappeared. In fact, if I remember correctly, she 
	was one of the ladies, that Jerry told Carmen, who was taken out of here by 
	Dr. Tachikawa. Her letter read: </span></p>

	<span style="font-family:Arial">&quot;Braintec Member,<br>
	This letter is to inform all who read it that I, Sonja Boutoille, have been 
	kidnapped by Dr. Tachikawa. I want to inform all who are new and all who 
	stay by will, that Braintec is only part of a much larger organization 
	called MemoCorp. I have heard them say they are inventing equipment for the 
	Pentagon and the CIA which can allow us to shoot a smaller version of our 
	implants into someone's head, at a distance of 200 meters. This is a means 
	of warfare that Dr. Tachikawa had been working on before he was fired from 
	the CIA.</span><span style="font-family: Arial"> </span>
	<span style="font-family:Arial">He continued his practice, only changing the 
	name to Braintec, to fool all those involved and retrieve many extractions. 
	If this smaller version is to be used as a 'bullet' implant, the owning 
	country could certainly monopolize any country they wish with their weapon 
	of war. This is why Dr. Tachikawa is in such a hurry to leave the United 
	States. The invention was intended for their country, but he has chosen to 
	take it to Japan. I have proof that some test subject have died from Dr. 
	Tachikawa's experiments. I urge all who care for their lives to get out now. 
	I am sure to be murdered for partaking in this leak of valuable information. 
	I feel my life is expendable should this information save the world. <br>

	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Her letter scared me a 
	bit. If the implant I had in my head caused so much trouble in my quiet 
	little life, imagine a country locked in prison cells receiving uploads of 
	fear and terror. It would be mental torture. After so many uploads, your 
	brain would eventually just fry. This was a thought I cared not to ponder 
	on.</span><p>
