    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">So 
    after all she did. When it was my turn to get an upload of Adelle’s memory, 
    I understood her choice. A hot summer night with Frank. A night, nothing in 
    particular, was happening. Some friends arrived to tell us all about their 
    holiday in Texas and later that night we were watching the stars. I was 
    happy.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I suspect that their 
    relation was perfect at this moment. For a long time they were not in love 
    anymore. It had been exchanged for something much deeper. Mutual confidence 
    and a serious solidarity. It was good. An enjoyable memory with a good, 
    peaceful feeling. Crickets were heard making loud sounds. The heat was 
    pleasant. I felt good, protected and in good spirits. This is my home.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Still enjoying the 
    good result which this memory had on me, I visited Adelle. I was glad I did. 
    I found her in her room where she was laying a cold wet towel on her eyes. 
    Her eyes were completely red and it looked as if she had been hit. <i>
    “Frank,”</i> she muttered, <i>“I really miss Frank so very much!”</i> She 
    pressed the towel even closer to her eyes. I took away the tissue and 
    caressed her hair. <i>“You are allowed to cry,”</i> I said. <i>“I have cried 
    already too often!”</i> And immediately her eyes were filled with tears 
    again. I grabbed a box of tissues from her desk and put it beside her. On 
    her bedside table were the left-over-chocolates which I put at the other 
    side of her. <i>“What else can I do for you?”</i> I felt so relieved and 
    happy that it must have looked like I was making a fool out of her. 
    Fortunately Adelle is attracted by humor and laughing and knew how to 
    interpret this. She suddenly started laughing and gave me a kiss. <i>“You 
    are helping me already by being here for me!”</i> She sighed deeply, blew 
    her nose and asked me in a whispering voice if I already had experienced her 
    memory. I nodded. What else could be the course of my happiness? She 
    desperately needed to hear my report. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“It was good,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    I declared. <i>“Very pleasant indeed. In close harmony.”</i> I was afraid I 
    would be wasting still more tears. On the contrary. <i>“Oh, yes!”</i> She 
    was almost shining. <i>“I spent such a good time with Frank! I want to keep 
    it and remind it that way. Everything that happens afterwards does not 
    matter anymore.”</i> It didn’t feel appropriate to ask her what went wrong 
    in the long run. If she doesn’t tell me personally, she doesn’t want me to 
    share her problem. The miscarriages were shooting like fireworks through my 
    head. </span></b></p>
