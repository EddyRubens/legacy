    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I bumped into him when 
    I left the coffee-room. Immediately my heart met my throat and my stomach 
    shrunk. <i>“Kodjiro,”</i> I muttered. I seemed to be in his way for he was 
    dying for a cup of coffee. He pushed me away, just like that. That hurt me. 
    Why this man could not reply to my love? At the same time I felt that anger 
    coming up again. Even if Dr. Tachikawa is too busy with his work, even if he 
    does not feel anything for me, he could easily treat me with some kind of 
    respect? Pushing me away like an old piece of dirt is out of the question.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>I walked over to 
    him, very angry. While he turned around to look at me, he raised his 
    eyebrows. That astonishment, or maybe it was indignation, took away my last 
    restraints. Did this Japanese never have the slightest idea what was going 
    on with me? I hit the coffee-jar out of his hands. <i>“No time for coffee 
    now!”</i> I snapped at him and looked at him in a very mean way. <i>“We are 
    going to talk. Right now!”</i> I think I never saw a person looking so much 
    surprised. <i>“Shall we go to your room then?”</i> he said with a soft voice. 
    I almost felt sorry for this man. Didn’t he realize at all what he was 
    bringing about?</b> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I felt very strange 
    when we walked towards my room. Of course I was glad that everything would 
    be clear to me at last. But the way how it was done was a bit strange. 
    Lately I can easily get so very angry that I can hardly recognize myself 
    anymore. I had left behind a big mess in the coffee-room. Coffee everywhere. 
    But Dr. Tachikawa walked with me, even if it was in a reluctant way. A 
    triumphant feeling. Yes, it was indeed. At last Dr. Tachikawa did what I 
    wanted him to do.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In my room he sat down 
    on my office-chair. I preferred to stand up for a while. What am I going to 
    tell him? Fortunately he broke silence. <i>“You simply could have made an 
    appointment with me. Sonja did the same yesterday.” </i>Oh no, not that way! 
    You know I can’t stand that. <i>“Yes, but I thought you were fully occupied 
    with your inventions and…..”</i> I totally lost control of my feeling of 
    victory. <i>“Yes, yes, I do understand,” </i>Kodjiro said and he stood up.
    <i>“I think it is all getting too much for you.”</i> I could not help 
    falling into tears again. Why did I care so much for this man? He is 
    impossible! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><i>
    “I thought…, I heard that….”</i> I stammered while he rubbed me over my 
    shoulder. <i>“Don’t make it hard on you,”</i> he comforted me. <i>“The only 
    person who can be of help to you is yourself!”</i> I looked at him through 
    my tears. Was it true what he told me? Kodjiro wiped tears from my face and 
    held me close. <i>“Otemba,”</i> he whispered softly. <i>“You know just as 
    well as I do that I’m not the man to have a relation with. That would be a 
    failure. I’m married to just one thing and that is science. All the other 
    stuff will remain in the background.” </i>I wished he could hold me like 
    this forever. But what I was already afraid of is the fact that he let go of 
    me and walked towards the door. I rushed after him and grabbed his arm. <i>
    “And what about Jessica?” </i>I asked in fear. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Kodjiro sighed heavily.
    <i>“Jessica is just Jessica,”</i> he declared. <i>“That’s all. What other 
    people are trying to say is partly true but it does not mean a thing. I 
    cannot tell you exactly the ins and outs of this matter but take it for 
    granted that she is a good girl. She really is in good hands with you, 
    believe me. Now, go and freshen yourself up because you have a date with 
    Sheila. Within three quarters of an hour.” </i>When Dr. Tachikawa walked out 
    of the room, he left a great emptiness. I cannot describe how I felt. Maybe 
    I did not feel anything. He called me Otemba again and he even held me into 
    his arms. I crawled against my quilt cover and hugged my rabbit. After that 
    I washed my face and brushed my teeth. An appointment with Sheila. I didn’t 
    know anything about that.</span></p>
