    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    nicest place to kill time is the Japanese garden. The vegetation is arranged 
    well and there are enough benches to sit on. I can sit there for hours while 
    watching the birds and making up life stories of unsuspecting passers by. On 
    weekdays there are less people in the garden. Especially Mondays and 
    Wednesdays, those are the quietest and thus nicest days. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Jessica came along with 
    me to the park this afternoon. She’s a nice girl. She’s sincerely interested 
    and her openness is inviting. This enables her to get much more information 
    out of me than Sheila, another test psychologist who usually irritates me 
    with her dopiness. Sheila is a dumb blonde. Jessica is good at what she does 
    because she has such an open personality, even after working hours. For a 
    moment I considered to talk to her about Dr. Tachikawa but I didn’t. I think 
    she finds him boring. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Jessica stays in the 
    research-center during the week because otherwise she will miss out on 
    leisure time. She lives in San Francisco, where she claims to have a ‘house 
    to die for’. She wouldn’t move for anything in the world, and with the 
    distance being so great she will only go home during weekends. Last time she 
    was mesmerizing about the ideal location and fabulous view, she told me that 
    maybe I could come along some time. I’m thinking it’s not such an ideal 
    location if she has to spend most of the week at Braintec. Still, she’s made 
    peace with the situation and even appreciates being in Portland from time to 
    time. Her rather than me, because I think Portland’s boring. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">At first I was wildly 
    enthusiastic about the city because it satisfied all the urban needs, 
    something Greenland</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> lacked. After more than a year of snow, ice, rocks and a population that 
    knows no cities bigger than Nuuk’s, with its population of 12.657, every 
    city is probably going to be fantastic in comparison. Now I see more narrow 
    mindedness in </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Portland than I saw in 
    the whole of Greenland</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> altogether. The American Dream, how low can you go? Yes, all those shops 
    come in handy when you need something. But if your needs are simple and you 
    refuse to let the media talk you into needing more, those overcrowded 
    streets are just plain irritating. Whenever I roam too long without any 
    purpose, I feel like somebody who’s homeless. I don’t get that feeling in 
    the Japanese garden; there you have to pay a small entry to get in. Nobody 
    is looking for food in the trash cans there. </span></p>
