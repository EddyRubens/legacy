    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    wasn’t difficult to choose a memory for today’s extraction session. I had 
    passionately spoken about my journey in Greenland before and the team asked 
    unanimously for a memory of that time. Dr. Tachikawa proposed to extract a 
    memory of a trip with the dogsledge. Simple but yet complete. A sore throat 
    blocked any verbal response. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The dogslegde trip! It’s 
    obvious that Dr. Tachikawa remembered my love-experience on the sledge very 
    well! It’s absolutely a fabulous memory but so private that I would never 
    wish to share it with all the others. I wish I had never talked about it 
    during that drunken night. My head felt like a huge red balloon while Dr. 
    Tachikawa’s eyes glittered attractively. I wouldn’t mind to share my most 
    intimate moments with Dr. Tachikawa, but definitely not with the rest of the 
    crew.&nbsp; What if Steward or Steve recalls my sexual splurges? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I could see at their 
    sober poses that Dr. Hamilton and the other doctors had no idea what was 
    going on between Dr. Tachikawa and me. Otherwise they would never have asked 
    for this memory. Or would they? No matter what their reason was; they kept 
    on asking for a memory of the dogsledge and had even started to prepare for 
    the extraction. I desperately searched for an alternative, a memory or 
    experience that would even outrank the dogslegde. But I couldn’t find any.
    <i>“Let’s see how good you can screen this memory!”</i>&nbsp; Dr. Tachikawa 
    smiled while he pushed me gently in the leather chair. Whatever. I’ve done 
    so many trips on a dogslegde while I was in Greenland. If I had fully 
    understood the procedure of the extractions, my most intimate moments wouldn’t 
    be in any danger if I could concentrate on any other trip with a dogslegde. 
    I couldn’t resist participating in Dr. Tachikawa’s little game and I smiled 
    as sensual at him as I could. <i>“Yes, let’s do just that. I know for sure 
    the test subjects would love this.”</i> </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Why am I so attracted 
    to this man? It seemed to be wise to keep this question unanswered before 
    Dr. Tachikawa would get a role play in my dogslegde-memory. I tried to 
    concentrate as much as possible and to focus all my thoughts at a certain 
    trip in Tasiilaq. I had a lot of help from the hypnotizer in this. His 
    relaxing words brought me back to the snow and the ice within a few moments. 
    The cries of the dogs and the icy cold weren’t difficult to remind. The 
    extracting moment is never experienced consciously. I still find that a pity. 
    I was able to watch the videotape as compensation, but there wasn’t much to 
    see on it. I was clearly under a deep hypnosis and my expressions revealed 
    that I was in a different world. My eyes were slightly narrowed to protect 
    them from icy wind while the corners of my mouth were stretched from joy. 
    And now I sincerely hope that no unprotected thoughts were extracted.</span><span style="font-family:Arial">
