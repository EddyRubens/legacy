	<span style="font-family:Arial">For some reason, I couldn't get it out of my 
	head as to why Kaleb just left us here. Did he have a plan, or did he just 
	have enough of this place? Even though he was with the CIA, he had no 
	personal obligations to any of us. Would he do that? Would he just turn his 
	back on us when he promised to help?</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Carmen said, <i>&quot;It's too bad that we can't 
	go down to where they stored his stuff. I wonder if anything he left here 
	could help us ... you know, like a clue.&quot; </i>I started to laugh. <i>&quot;Jinkies, 
	Scooby Doo,...you think we should investigate?&quot; </i>I said to her. <i>&quot;I 
	guess that did sound pretty stupid, huh!&quot;</i> Carmen said while laughing.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">A while later, Carmen and I decided to walk 
	around the facility to kill some time. We wanted to look in Kaleb's room. 
	Was it still empty? Did they put someone else in there? We wanted to know. 
	Also, Braintec welcomed some new test subject a few days ago. If all their 
	testing was done, they should be getting ready for their surgeries. We 
	wanted to go see what they were like. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When we reached Kaleb's old room, I knocked 
	on the door. There was no answer. I knocked again. Since there was still no 
	answer I reached out to the doorknob to see if it would open. Just when I 
	was trying to turn the obviously locked knob, a voice shouted at Carmen and 
	I. <i>&quot;Hey! What are you two ladies doing here?&quot;</i> We both turned to our 
	right to see one of the security nurses coming our way. I looked at Carmen 
	and quickly whispered for her to go along with what I was saying. She 
	nodded. <i>&quot;I said...What are you doing here?&quot;</i> He repeated in a 
	sarcastic tone.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I put on act saying, <i>&quot;Oh, this is my 
	friends room. Maybe you know him, Kaleb. Well,...he promised me that he 
	would copy this totally awesome CD for me... Well,...I guess it's called 
	burning a CD,...But, anyway,...He said he would do that for me...So, I told 
	him I was going to come by today...I don't think I said what time...But, I 
	did say today.....But, he's not here,..I wonder if he's getting an 
	upload...or maybe he went for an early dinner...or maybe....&quot; &quot;Okay, 
	Okay.....I get it!&quot;</i> he interrupted. I knew my senseless babbling would 
	throw him off. <i>&quot;Look,&quot;</i> he continued, <i>&quot;You mine as well forget 
	about your CD or what ever it is, cause this Kaleb guy isn't around anymore.&quot; 
	&quot;Not around? What do you mean?&quot;</i> I said in a confused voice. <i>&quot;Exactly 
	what I'm saying...he's not here...he's gone...he left...ringing any bells?&quot; 
	&quot;So...when is he supposed to be back?&quot;</i> Carmen said, acting just as 
	confused as I was. The security guard stared at us for a moment then sighed 
	deeply and shook his head. He just turned and walked away.&nbsp; </span>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I just looked at Carmen 
	and smiled. We make a great team. </span></p>
