    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Today nothing had been 
    scheduled in my agenda. Tomorrow I will give presentations again; three a 
    day. Right now I rather would have done one of these locations to divide the 
    rush somehow. Unfortunately no possibility for that. Sometimes you cannot 
    make up your mind. Actually it was great to have the day off. That brought 
    me a chance to visit Amsterdam for the day. I still got some friends living 
    over there and thought of paying them a visit. No time for that after all. I 
    did some shopping, bought myself new shoes, etc. And I also visited the 
    Stedelijk Museum. Good to be back in Amsterdam. I really like this city.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    was joining the queue for a strawberry milkshake at Burger King. Milkshakes 
    and bagels have become an essential part of my daily diet. Hard to find 
    bagels here but luckily milkshakes are. When it was my turn my portable 
    phone started ringing. The TROS speaking, somebody from Radio Online. If I 
    was able to come to their program this evening. Through others they had 
    heard about Braintec and they thought it a great idea to discuss the matter 
    on the radio. I would have a chance to explain about Braintec and request 
    people to become new test subjects. Perfect indeed, a free offer for 
    publicity! I used to listen to Radio Online with pleasure; it is an 
    enjoyable program. All arrangements seemed to be last-minute but that is 
    quite normal. I had to hurry a bit to reach the studio in time. Actually I 
    wanted to buy a souvenir for Kodjiro. Lack in duty.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was a very pleasant 
    experience. I was nervous seeing this huge blue microphone just in front of 
    my nose. It did not matter. When Francisco van Jole (one of the journalists) 
    interviewed my first memory, I enthusiastic started talking about my 
    childhood. Explained that I was lying in my bed and felt so peaceful. Of 
    course he meant which memory I got first as upload! At Braintec we usually 
    talk about memories in general continuously, that’s why I started talking 
    about my own first memory automatically. Maybe nobody noticed it and they 
    assume that it was my first upload. Fine with me. A memory which I would 
    like to experience again, anyway. </span></p>
