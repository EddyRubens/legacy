    <span style="font-family: Arial">It feels like every hour doubles while 
    waiting for 6:00 to arrive. I did the rounds of the halls, got some juicy

    <span style="font-family: Arial">I saw Carmen in the hall earlier this 
    afternoon. I smiled at her and said,<i> 'Hi!'</i> She just stared at me. I'm 
    not sure if she is still mad. I can't read her like I use to be able to. You 
    know how you can tell if someone is happy or sad or scared or mad? Well, she 
    wasn't showing anything. I decided to just leave her alone. I have been 
    making the effort to stay out of her way. When she is ready for conversation 
    she will come to me.</span></p>

    Monkey's are the funniest animals around, and Chocolate is the cure for 
    sadness. If you eat one Monkey day, It would surely bring you gladness!</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I thought it was a 
    little cheesy but I thought Carmen would get a kick out of it. The woman 
    gift wrapped it for me for free and I headed back.</span></p>
