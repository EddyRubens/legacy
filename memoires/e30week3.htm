    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    trembled as I looked down. So high! I could tell that Adrian was as 
    frightened as I was. <i>“You can still call it off,”</i> I whispered. <i>
    “Sonja never got an assignment to take you out, right?”</i> Adrian grabbed 
    hold of my hand. <i>“We’re in this together,”</i> he said. I squeezed his 
    hand to show my appreciation. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“Remember well,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    Paul said, <i>“Sonja told you this is going to be the most intense 
    experience of your lives. Feel free to worry about your parachutes opening 
    on time. It will only make it more believable.”</i> That remark didn’t go 
    down well with me. What if the parachute didn’t open indeed? What if this 
    was a set up and we’re about to plunge to our deaths? <i>“Great! You’re 
    really getting into it now!”</i> Paul encouraged me. <i>“I’m going down now 
    to make sure I’m there when you land. Take your time, you two. Take long 
    enough to put me out of your minds.”</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was scared. I was so 
    scared I would’ve done anything to get out of this. Was there really no 
    other way? Adrian appeared to sense my fear. <i>“It’s not exactly bungee 
    jumping but this is what it we’ll have to get our kicks when we live without 
    uploads from now on.” </i>His smile worked like fairy dust. I have to admit 
    it was pretty cool. Who else has adventures like these? Who else hurries 
    into a train to end up jumping off a building all within the space of one 
    and a half hour? My fear was replaced with an exhilarating sense of freedom. 
    The wind in my hair, the sound of a seagull in the distance and down there 
    just air. An awful lot of air that I would be immersed in as I’d fall down. 
    If this was my life, just as well. We looked each other in the eye, laughed 
    out loud and made the jump. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    went terribly fast but the experience was so intense it seemed as if each 
    second took minutes. The air pulled at everything. The skin of my face was 
    pulled to one side and the wind made my eyes really dry. During the fall I 
    couldn’t breathe. As the parachute opened I felt the shock of slowing down 
    so sudden. Then we drifted slowly downward. It was beautiful! Adrian was 
    smiling ear to ear. </span></p>
