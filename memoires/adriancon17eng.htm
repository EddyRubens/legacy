    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I have been to the pub 
    with Rosanne last Saturday, after we had some kind of picnic at the 
    waterfront. We had uploads in stead of food. Rosanne choose one from Adelle 
    with Frank, I choose the upload with the rubber boat for myself. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I found the fear and 
    uncertainty hided in this upload appropriate for this moment. Where can we 
    go as insignificant creatures in this huge world? How is my life going to be? 
    Strangely it wasn’t scary this time. I loved the silence inside the boat. 
    Released from all the things that strangled me I had the opportunity to 
    choose. Peddling further towards an other life or going back to the sailing 
    vessel and revert to old certainties. &nbsp;I was the one to decide. That gave me 
    a great feeling.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic" lang="nl">
    <a target="_top" href="adrianlink3eng.htm">find out how Adrian experienced 
    this before</a></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After the uploads we 
    stayed for a while watching over the river. We both had our own thoughts. It 
    was quiet and silent. If this is the end of it, I mean the opportunity to 
    have uploads, I will miss it. Then I have to read books again and watch 
    movies and that takes hours and hours. Besides that: an upload is a so much 
    more intensive experience than anything else. Everything is in it. Smell 
    feelings images sound, compare that with the “old” media. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After fifteen minutes 
    we were going further. First to eat something and then we arrived at Elisa’s. 
    I asked Rosanne what she knew. About Steward, Hamilton and last but not 
    least Sonja. We agreed about Hamilton. He was just trying to keep the 
    company alive. I think he is honourable. But we can’t trust Steward. If I 
    ask him something he doesn’t like answering, he ignores my question and 
    starts about something completely different. Rosanne has noticed that as 
    well. <i>“What do you think of Sonja’s story?”</i>, Rosanne asked. I don’t know. It 
    could all be true, but it also sounds a bit like fantasy. Paranoid symptoms, 
    if that’s what they are, are difficult to recognize at such a distance. 
    Nothing is completely under control. It must be very scary for Sonja. 
    Whenever it is real or in her imagination. Wonder where she might be. <i>“Do 
    you think she's really in Japan?”</i> I ask Rosanne. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><i>“I have a reliable 
    Japanese e-mail address of her so I don’t have doubt about that. I only 
    wonder if she is in search for Kodjiro or Jessica”.</i> I ask Rosanne to let me 
    know it she has news about her. It could be very important for my choice 
    between staying here and going to Japan as well. <i>“O.K.”</i> I close the subject, until now it is Kodjiro, Jessica and Sonja who went to Japan. I wonder who 
    will be next.”</span></p>
