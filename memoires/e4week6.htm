    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">I saw a vase. A red 
    vase with a ribbed base, and a handle. Quite an ugly vase, really. If 
    someone would bring flowers as a gift, putting them in such a vase would be 
    an insult, ghastly! This vase is the first memory that’s been implanted in 
    me. I didn’t only see the vase, I felt it as well. The material felt rough 
    and cold in my hands. I couldn’t smell anything; maybe it was too clean to 
    be smelly. It’s a strange experience, this vase. Like dreaming with my eyes 
    open. An image formed on my retina, fingers feeling matter and arm muscles 
    making a mild effort to carry the imaginary object. </span>

    vase</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">,</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
    no</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial"> doubt. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">The doctors were wildly enthusiastic when I 
    told them it was a vase. Even before we walked out of the lab they were 
    already holding glasses of champagne. The team’s exuberance, their combined 
    enthusiasm was contagious. The image of that hideous vase gained a sort of 
    merry charm. I was given a glass of champagne as well. It was as if I had 
    passed an important exam. My implant works!</span></b></p>
