	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I returned to my partially vacant room, 
	I was undecided on what to do. I was use to having Carmen around to keep me 
	company. I sat for a few minutes and stared off into subconscience. I 
	couldn't help but realize that 'they' finally accomplished what I feared the 
	most. Kaleb was gone. Megan was gone. Carmen was gone. And I was alone.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I gazed aimlessly for a few moments until a 
	crying scream came from the hall. I opened my door and saw a young girl with 
	Sheila. She must have been about seventeen or eighteen. She was blonde with 
	a naive, yet innocent face. She spoke with a French accent. <i>&quot;No,..No! Not 
	without my baby! My Stella! Please bring her to me! Please!&quot; </i>She cried. 
	Sheila was forcefully walking her down the hall. There were two security 
	nurses walking behind them. I suppose they must have been there for 
	reinforcement in case she were to break free from Sheila. They walked toward 
	my door with the girl still crying. She turned her head and looked me in the 
	eyes as they passed the door. Her look stabbed my heart with sorrow. I 
	instantly felt and honest connection to her. Something bad was happening to 
	her, just as something bad has happened Kaleb, Megan, Carmen, and fearfully, 
	myself.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Once they were clear from the hall, I walked 
	out to see Jerry. He was standing behind the front counter with Thomas. They 
	were whispering something to one another and they both looked worried. <i>
	&quot;You guys, what is going on? Who was that girl?&quot;</i> I asked Neither of them 
	answered me. I looked at Thomas, but he stared at the ground and made no eye 
	contact with me. When I looked to Jerry, he had a strange look on his face. 
	He widened his eyes and motioned them to the left of where he was standing. 
	I slowly turned my head to see Dr. Hamilton with his back to us. He was near 
	the front door whispering something to Steward. When he turned around, he 
	looked me eye to eye for a moment, then headed for the 'Left Wing.' When I 
	turned back around, Jerry handed me a folded piece of paper. <i>&quot;Here is the 
	number to that little Mexican restaurant you were asking about.&quot; </i>He said 
	louder than he normally speaks. I took the paper from him, shoved it into 
	the pocket of my jeans, and loudly thanked him for finding the phone number. 
	I headed back to my room waiting to read whatever was written. If it was 
	something that could risk the safety of Jerry or Thomas, I didn't want to 
	take the chance.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I closed my door and pushed the chair up 
	under the doorknob. It was a sad attempt for a lock, but it would give me a 
	chance to hide the paper if needed. I opened the folded note. It said:</span></p>
