    <span style="font-family: Arial">It's almost 5pm right now. I just returned 
    from my first day testing. Sheila came by about 7:30 this morning to pick me 
    up. Luckily, I took a shower last night and set my alarm to wake up early. I 
    wonder how many days I will have to go through tests before they decide if I 
    am an acceptable test subject. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Today I went to this room with Sheila. I am 
    guessing it was her office. She asked me a bunch of questions about why I 
    wanted to do this and what I hoped to get out of this experience. Then she 
    asked me a whole bunch of personal questions. She made me feel a bit 
    uncomfortable. I really didn't see how any of it was relevant. I suppose 
    there is a reason to all those particular types of questions. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">She was extremely interested in the fact 
    that I had some phobias. Four to be exact. I have a fear of bees, (Apiphobia) 
    fear of wasps, (Spheksophobia) and a fear of being stung by them. (Cnidophobia) 
    These three are all related in a way. People thing I am joking or lying 
    about it. But, my fear of them is so great that if a bee or wasp is anywhere 
    near, I basically have a panic attack. It's uncontrollable. I have a feeling 
    these phobias lead back to something that happened at childhood. I get all 
    shaky and short winded just thinking about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">The forth phobia I have, I am a little 
    embarrassed to admit to. It's called Automatonophobia. This one is the fear 
    of ventriloquist's dummies, animatronic creatures, wax statues and anything 
    that falsely represents a sentient being. How this came about, I am totally 
    clueless. About five years ago, Carrie and I went to this party. It was sort 
    of boring and one of the guys that lived in the house said he had this 
    really cool collection, and asked if I wanted to see it. He wouldn't tell me 
    what the collection was, but when I went into his room, I had one of my 
    panic attacks. I completely shut down and this guy had to carry me back out 
    into the living room. I was so embarrassed. His collection was all these 
    little puppets and marionettes. I mentioned this fear to Sheila during our 
    testing session. She kept saying: <i>&quot;I see...and how did you feel about 
    that?&quot;&nbsp;</i> I was getting a bit frazzled by her repetitive comments. I felt 
    like telling her that I was starting to get annoyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">She gave me an hour break at 11:30am for 
    lunch. I don't remember seeing a cafeteria here, so I hit up some vending 
    machines and went back to my room.&nbsp; I ate the small bag of Doritos, the 
    giant, chewy, oatmeal cookie, (yummy!) and drank my Diet Coke. That took 
    about 15 minutes so I decided to take a 30 minute nap then head back to 
    Sheila's office.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">I spent the rest of the day with Sheila 
    answering questions. She told me tomorrow I would be doing some physical 
    testing and some different kind of mental testing. Finally something 
    different. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen mentioned something about getting 
    take-out Chinese food for dinner. While she is calling the restaurant, I am 
    going to write Josh and see if I have any email from him. Then Carmen and I 
    will sit near the front door to wait for </span>
