    Today it was such a busy one. In the morning we have extracted a memory of 
    my fourth birthday and I’ve got it uploaded in the afternoon. Such sessions 
    are tiresome. Physically I am a wreck by now –headache, sickness and my 
    muscles feel as if I run a marathon- but that doesn’t matter at all. ‘Coss 
    such an upload is really great. I am still enjoying the memory. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">An extraction is very 
    tiresome because you have to focus your mind so long and so intensively. I’m 
    glad the hypnotizer helps with that, but afterwards I’ve always the feeling 
    that it’s the better to stay in my bed for the rest of the day. Other test 
    subjects with a MESI don’t think it’s that tiring as I do, so I have to be 
    careful not to play the idiot. Perhaps I was just more tired because we had 
    to dig deeper to get this memory. I liked the Disney-memory of Robbert so 
    much, that I asked to recall a memory from my own childhood. I couldn’t 
    remember much and it was even harder to know in which year it happened. <i>
    “That doesn’t matter.”</i> the hypnotizer said, called Lennard Victoroff&nbsp; <i>
    “If we both concentrate on that, it will all come back.”</i> That was an 
    exiting prospect. We did need some kind of guidelines and therefore we chose 
    my fourth birthday. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">During the hypnosis 
    and right afterwards I suddenly remembered how it was to be four years old. 
    But only during the upload I really experienced being four. Fantastic. It is 
    a memory I love to keep in mind as long as possible. I was a little queen, 
    the shining center of all the excitement. I don’t remember a cake. I thought 
    I would blow four candles on a cake, very common, but there wasn’t any. The 
    odd perspective was perhaps the most fascinating thing. The table was so 
    high that I couldn’t clearly observe what was on it. And I had to pull at 
    people’s legs to get their attention. That wasn’t a problem with the 
    children from my neighborhood. Ronald, Jenny en Annemieke visited us and my 
    nephew Henk as well. They just did what they wanted while it was my birthday. 
    Suddenly this queen became a dictator, because they were not allowed to 
    touch the new toys. Unbelievable, how small and well-organized the world is 
    for a four-year-old child. Except for the perspective. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I have a good feeling 
    about my childhood. Such a recall isn’t easy to let go. It opens a lot of 
    doors and I was totally forgotten what was behind them. The memories come 
    back in my mind as a chain reaction. How I had a fight with Annemieke, how 
    it felt when daddy was angry and above all my cuddly-toys. I have been 
    thinking about my teddies during the whole evening. I used to find dolls 
    boring, but I have spent many years with little animal friends. Sometimes I 
    was the vet and then they would all get a bandage. And I played monopoly 
    with them quite often. But I was older then. I almost think that I miss my 
    cuddly-toys. Fortunately I have my grey rabbit now.</span></p>
