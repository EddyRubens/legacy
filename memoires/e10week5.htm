    subjects were all very much stressed. Understandable, ‘coss their test 
    results will be discussed this afternoon and they will be informed whether 
    they are allowed to get an implant or have to leave. </b></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I never had to answer 
    so many questions. They were all worried. Even Alice, who seems to be okay 
    after all. <i>“What if this goes wrong, what if that goes wrong?”</i> I 
    couldn’t answer all the questions, but I think I could reassure them a bit. 
    My soothing words had also a positive effect on myself. I started to believe 
    in my own comforts more and more. <i>“Yes, it is a safe procedure. Besides 
    some inconveniences there is nothing scary to expect.”</i> They were also 
    uncertain for the test results. <i>“What was your answer to the question of 
    the use of alcohol?”</i> I recognized this uncertainty and I could guarantee 
    that it couldn’t be that hard because I also passed that test. I am going to 
    take part of the evaluation team and I promised I would have a good word 
    with all five of them. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was funny to see 
    the evaluation from the other side. The test results were converted to 
    beautiful graphics, through which you could see which brain parts were 
    developed the best. The EEG-results and the MRI-scan confirmed or denied 
    that. I have asked for a bit more information about the importance of this, 
    but I was called back with a view on the clock. <i>“Within the time we had 
    for you evaluation some months ago, we now have to decide what’s going to 
    happen to five test subjects!”</i> That kept me quiet for the rest of the 
    meeting and therefore I didn’t say a word when they decided that it would be 
    better for Thomas if he went home tomorrow. The reason isn’t clear to me, 
    but Thomas is not suitable for an implant. The other test subjects will go 
    to the hypnotizer, one by one, to find out who might probably get a MESI. 
    After that they will all be admitted to the left wing. There I’ll give my 
    responsibility into the hands of others for a couple of days. I intend to 
    visit them after the operations. </span></p>
    <p><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Next Monday a new 
    group of test subjects will arrive. I became very quiet when Dr. Hamilton 
    noticed that the Californian woman would be among them. I am allowed to give
    <i>her </i>a preferential treatment, he specifically told me so.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">
