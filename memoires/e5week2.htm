    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">With 
    mixed feelings I underwent my second re-experience today. The first one was 
    really impressive, but seeing the real vase was such a disappointment. Dr. 
    Tachikawa guaranteed me that this would not be the case today. It’s not 
    possible to tell what kind of memory it is before it is uploaded because 
    that will spoil the end results. What has been made clear is that it won’t 
    be a painful, unpleasant or awkward memory. During my first series of 
    sessions the memories to be relived will only be the most banal and trivial 
    experiences anyway. Still, it’s exciting! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The team welcomed me 
    enthusiastically and it seemed like they were all looking forward to it. I 
    sat in the chair again, remembering the routine. The procedure was carefully 
    explained again and I may have nodded in agreement a bit too much. It’s not 
    as if I’d forgotten how it was done. The elaborate explaining is probably 
    obligatory, like the gestures stewardesses make when the safety regulations 
    are explain in an airplane. In a one to one situation you can’t really stare 
    through the window looking bored though. Hence my polite nodding. After the 
    relaxation exercises the reliving came faster than I expected. I don’t know 
    if it took longer before the upload started yesterday but today it took me a 
    little by surprise. Suddenly it got real bright. A burning heat on my skin, 
    but not unpleasant. Colors formed before my eyes as I kept them firmly shut. 
    I tried to see images in the colors before me but I couldn’t make anything 
    out of it. But I did experience contentment, a restful feeling that was 
    quite pleasant. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Time seemed to be 
    standing still while it lasted not more than a second. Then suddenly it was 
    over. <i>“I don’t know,”</i> was the first thing I said. <i>“Take it easy, 
    give it some time.”</i> I was encouraged to remain seated for a while. Then 
    the questions came. I explained what it had been like for me and that I 
    hadn’t seen any pictures, like the vase. Big smiles appeared on the team 
    member’s faces. Despite my feeling of failure I was on target. Not all 
    memories come as images, they explained to me. This was a re-experience of 
    relaxing in the sun. My coin dropped at this explanation. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">Of course! </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">I had been looking for the memory of an 
    object or an occurrence. You can’t manipulate the upload then. </span></b>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">So simple yet so 
    complex. Maybe sitting in the sun, relaxing in real time is just as complex 
    as this memory, but I’ve never realized that before. It was nice. Sitting in 
    the sun is lovely of course, but the memory was actually better. I think I 
    felt happy, a type of contentment that borders on completeness. I felt 
    complete; nothing else was needed to make me feel good. Memories like that 
    they can upload with no limit, as far as I’m concerned. </span></p>
