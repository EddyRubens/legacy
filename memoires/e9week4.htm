    upload of my own dogslegde-trip was different than I expected. I thought it 
    would be more clinical. It was the first time that I already knew what kind 
    of memory I would recall and maybe that made the difference. Now I could 
    imagine how it would be. The whole morning I was with all of my thoughts 
    back on the ice in Greenland. I called all the dogs by name;</span><b><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></b>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">Iluliaq and Immaqa, Kajortoq, Naasoq 
    and Sukkulaati</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"> 
    with the spots. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">All 
    of them hard workers. They ran their longs out of their bodies for the 
    little bit of meat they would get at the end of the day. A speed of 60 
    kilometers an hour is common on flat plains. I always become a bit homesick 
    when I think about the good things in Greenland. But this homesickness was 
    never as strong as after the recall of the dogslegde ride. I was so totally 
    back in Greenland that the tears sprung from my eyes. I couldn’t stop crying 
    and felt ashamed. Dr. Hamilton and Steward paced up and down the room while 
    Jessica gave me some tissues to clean my nose. In the meantime she softly 
    massaged my neck. Dr. Tachikawa left the room expressionless. Why did I ever 
    leave Greenland? I felt so much like home! </span></p>
