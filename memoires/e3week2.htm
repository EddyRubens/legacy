    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Last 
    night we had a serious panic. I had an epileptic seizure, an attack that’s a 
    lot more serious than the neurological responses I experienced before. I 
    don’t remember the moment itself. I fell asleep right after the attack from 
    which they woke me. They were afraid I might go into a coma. That’s what I 
    overheard Dr. Tachikawa when I came to. I found it a bit disturbing that 
    they looked at the EEG and tested my eye reflexes before the nurse was 
    allowed to change me.&nbsp; I had peed in my pants during the attack and was 
    quite embarrassed. Because of the anxious behavior of the doctors I got a 
    bit shaky. <i>“Take it out,”</i> I shouted, <i>“it’s not working!”</i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I felt totally 
    threatened and was frightened of another, possibly worse, epileptic seizure. 
    There might well be serious damage in my brain, serious consequences. The 
    nurse tried to put me at ease but that had an opposite effect. She acted as 
    if she knew exactly what was going on but it was clear to me that she knew 
    as little about this brain surgery stuff as me. I had seen the doctors’ 
    panic, hadn’t I? How could I stay at ease? Dr. Tachikawa went out of his way 
    for my benefit. I think he explained about five times how an epileptic 
    seizure is caused and how the brain restores itself. I believe him. He 
    radiates honesty while not hiding his worries. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I’m getting special 
    medication to stop the attacks. Anti-epileptics; Tegretol, Mysoline with 
    caffeine. I probably have to take these pills for only one week, enough to 
    give my brain time to recover from the effects of the operation. And they 
    have moved me to the observation room again. I hate that stupid mirror. It would be incredibly stupid if I got myself afflicted with a 
    really serious affection for the rest of my life, all because of this 
    project. </span></p>
