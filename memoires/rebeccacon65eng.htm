    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">So many things were 
    going through my mind. I wanted to run back and tell Carmen what was 
    happening, but I was afraid that I might miss something. I thought I was out 
    of site until felt someone put their hands on my shoulders. It was Adrian. I 
    was so involved with the happenings that I didn't even hear him come up 
    behind me. <i>&quot;Oh, Adrian...&quot; </i>I said. <i>&quot;You startled me!&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He looked at me then 
    gave me sort of a half smile. <i>&quot;How was your dinner last night?&quot;</i> He 
    asked. <i>&quot;Oh...Ummm...It was good.&quot;</i> I answered. I figured since Carmen 
    said I left an open invitation I would use it to my advantage. I know Adrian 
    knows a lot that goes on around here. He even has his own little office 
    somewhere, where he works on things pertaining to Braintec. (Or, so I've 
    heard) <i>&quot;So what's going on around here?&quot; </i>I continued. <i>&quot;Dr. 
    Hamilton seems to be freaking out, and now the police are their way.&quot;</i> He 
    answered, <i>&quot;Yea, Dr. Tachikawa left last night. I guess he and Dr. 
    Hamilton got into a fight yesterday and...well, now he's gone.&quot; &quot;But why did 
    he call the police?&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;I really shouldn't be telling you all 
    this.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;I'm not supposed to discuss company business with 
    the test subjects.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;Oh,&quot;</i> I said. 
    (He kinda irritated me) <i>&quot;Well, I guess this lab rat, or...test subject, 
    will just have to find things out for herself. I mean, if something bad is 
    happening here I want to know. I don't plan to stay around here if there's 
    trouble.&quot;</i>&nbsp; I figured that sounded good. Like I was worried, without 
    being too involved. I didn't want to seem desperate for answers, though I 
    really was. <i>&quot;No Rebecca,&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;You're taking it the wrong way!&quot;</i> 
    I turned around and gave him a look as though he had hurt my feelings. He 
    didn't really, I just wanted him to think he did. <i>&quot;OK...look.&quot; </i>He 
    said. <i>&quot;All I can tell you is the two of them got into an argument 
    yesterday, Dr. Tachikawa left last night and he took some of the equipment 
    with him.&quot; &quot;Sorry Adrian,&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;I just didn't get a lot of sleep 
    last night an I am a bit grumpy. </i>(That was a lie)<i> So he left, huh? 
    Where do you think he could have went?&quot; &quot;Who knows...probably back to 
    Japan.&quot;</i> Adrian said.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">'Oh, my God,' was all 
    I could think. Japan! Could the CIA even go there and arrest someone? Or did 
    they have to involve the Japanese police? I really needed to inform Agent 
    Andrews. I stood with Adrian as we watched Dr. Hamilton tell the Police 
    there was some sort of miscommunication with the staff. He told them that 
    they found what they were looking for and apologized for the 
    misunderstanding. I was still worried. It could have been because Dr. 
    Hamilton did such a good cover up. Had he done this before? What exactly did 
    Steward tell him earlier? I figured that I got about as much information as 
    I would be able to. I excused myself from Adrian and told him I promised to 
    go to lunch with my roommate. <i>&quot;Didn't you girls just go out to dinner?&quot;
    </i>He asked. I needed a quick excuse. <i>&quot;Yea, well...she has been having a 
    lot of problems...and I'm just trying to be a good friend.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Maybe you and 
    I can go get some lunch sometime.&quot;</i> He said. I just smiled at him and 
    said, <i>&quot;Well, I'll see you around.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I turned around and 
    walked back to my room. Dr. Tachikawa is gone! I couldn't help but feel a 
    little happy. This ordeal was far out of my reach now. Maybe I'll be able to 
    finally go home.</span></p>
