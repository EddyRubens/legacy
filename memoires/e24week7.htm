    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">We 
    had to interrupt our party. The door opened and there was Dr. Hamilton. We 
    were deadly frightened. Without saying one word the director walked into the 
    lab and grabbed the M-Store and the charger still lying on the table. Adrian 
    switched off the monitor within a reflection. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>“Did you give her 
    an upload?”</i> he asked strictly. Adrian nodded his head and stared at the 
    floor. <i>“It’s my entire fault!”</i> I shouted. <i>“I nagged him just long 
    enough till he gave me one. First he didn’t want to give me one for he 
    thought it could only be done in a serious session, but finally I kept on 
    nagging till he admitted!”</i> My lies came tumbling down and I kept on 
    talking. <i>“Will you stop now!”</i> Dr. Hamilton roared. <i>“I’m fed up 
    with you. Tomorrow morning your implant is out!”</i> He slammed the door 
    behind him. </span></p>

    Tears appeared just like that. Adrian tried to comfort me and thanked me for 
    protecting him. But nobody could comfort me. They would take out my implant! 
    This was my last upload! Adrian reached me a glass of water and I tried to 
    stabilize my mind. <i>“Can I use your phone?”</i> I asked after some silent 
    minutes. Adrian gave me his portable phone. I picked the ticket to Tokyo out 
    of my pocket. One reason or another it felt good to carry it along with me. 
    I called the reservation number and managed to get a flight at four o’clock 
    in the morning. Perfect. I was relieved taking a breath. I can keep my 
    implant and in the long run I would have gone to Tokyo anyway. For Sonja, 
    for Kodjiro or simply for the fact I still had this ticket.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian insisted in 
    bringing me to the airport. That’s very kind. The only thing I had with me 
    was my rucksack, some clothes, my laptop, small camera and some rubbish. The 
    remaining stuff was not that important, I didn’t need them in Greenland 
    either. I assured Adrian he could blame me for everything. He seemed to be 
    happy with that. <i>“Maybe I will follow you once!”</i> he muttered and we 
    gave each other a hug. <i>“Thank you for everything!”</i> I yelled at him.
    <i>“Same to you!”</i> Adrian called.</span></p>
