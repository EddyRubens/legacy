    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I’ve 
    been reading Sonja’s mail all over, three times. What was going on with her? 
    She describes me as being her lifeline. Her connection, like a navel string. 
    Maybe I ought to help her. I could take Kodjiro’s plane ticket to visit her 
    in Tokyo. But, for God’s sake, how am I going to find her? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Such kidnapping 
    definitely impressed her in a terrible way. But still I cannot believe they 
    are going to kill her. A while ago Hugo was still so much worried about her. 
    He wouldn’t like the idea that they murder his own wife, does he? No, I 
    don’t believe in that. Maybe her paranoia behavior exists out of her former 
    memories. Sometimes I also experience bad moods through it. Disgusting, what 
    she’s going through. I wished I knew how I could help her.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adelle doesn’t believe 
    it, no way. She does worry about Sonja but she argues that she has not been 
    kidnapped. Although she underlines the fact that Dr. Tachikawa is capable in 
    doing weird things. She also worries about Sonja because she still has an 
    implant in her head. One day or another they have to take it out. And she’s 
    got this unpleasant feeling that she has to make up her mind. I asked her 
    about her choice she desperately had made. <i>“Sonja kindly requested in her 
    email not to talk about it with the group. Don’t you think it is for her 
    sake that I still discuss it? At least she has gotten a huge psychosis and 
    can be of danger to herself.&quot;</i> I hope I was able to hush Adelle. I came 
    to a point where I was worried myself, now I trivialized the whole matter.
    <i>“I think, everything is going smooth, Adelle,”</i> I tried. <i>“Don’t 
    talk about it with anybody. Just wait, at least, another couple of days.”</i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Although I can get along with Adelle very well, I shouldn’t trust her too 
    much for that matter. Fortunately I didn’t tell her about the plane ticket. 
    By changing subject as soon as possible, I therefore asked her about the 
    latest developments with Frank. That hit a good score. Out of the abundance 
    of the heart the mouth spoke. She explained about the discussions between 
    Braintec and the army. About Dr. Hamilton getting along very well with the 
    officers. At the beginning of this week they showed up with a cash advance 
    and later this week the total budget will be known. It made my flesh creep 
    while Adelle was talking gladly about the recent developments. Didn’t Sonja 
    write in her email about the Ministry of Defense who would support Braintec 
    as an important investor? How well the inventor’s intentions of gunpowder 
    were, the results were a catastrophe!</span></p>
