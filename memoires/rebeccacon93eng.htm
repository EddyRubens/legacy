	<span style="font-family:Arial">I walked quickly down the hall trying not to 
	look conspicuous. When I found Carmen's room I decided it would be best to 
	look through the little window in the door. I wouldn't want to walk in and 
	find Dr. Hamilton or worse yet, Sheila, sitting there. The coast was clear.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I walked in, Carmen was sleeping. I 
	hated to wake her but I wanted her to know that I was here for her. When I 
	walked up to the side of her bed, I put my left hand on her head and ran my 
	fingers through her hair. She opened her eyes and stared at me for a moment. 
	She was clearly drained from her experience the other day. <i>&quot;Becka,&quot;</i> 
	She managed to say. <i>&quot;I didn't think you'd find me!&quot; </i>Tears began to 
	form in her eyes. <i>&quot;What?&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;You think I would give up that 
	easy?&quot; </i>I told her that I knew she had the baby two nights ago. She told 
	me that Dr. Hamilton, was very kind to her during the whole thing. Steward 
	was the one who hooked up the devices for the extractions.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial"><i>&quot;Max is in an incubator across the hall. 
	They said whenever I feel up to it I can go see him.&quot;</i> She said. <i>&quot;But 
	they also told me for security reasons I have to move to a different section 
	of the facility. I guess there are two other girls with MESI babies. We are 
	all going to be in a hidden section of the building.&quot; </i>I told Carmen not 
	to worry, that I would find a way for us to stay together, or at least visit 
	all the time until we were taken out of here. Then I promised her that I 
	would go to see Max before I left. I informed her when I arrived that I was 
	scheduled for an upload and could only stay for a short while. Before I 
	left, I told her how Kaleb was sending someone trustworthy to take us out of 
	this place. <i>&quot;I'm not leaving here without Max!&quot;</i> She said. <i>&quot;Carm,&quot;</i> 
	I said. <i>&quot;There is no way I would ever think to leave without him.&quot;</i> I 
	give her a kiss on the forehead and told her that I would come back tomorrow 
	and we could talk more. </span></p>

	<span style="font-family:Arial">I left her room and glanced into the room 
	across the hall. Inside, there was an incubator with a tiny little baby 
	inside. I walked up to it and felt a tear roll down my cheek. I felt so sad 
	for little Max. He was so tiny and helpless. And he was in that condition 
	because that bastard, Dr. Tachikawa. He is the one that influenced Carmen 
	into thinking that this was OK to do. I couldn't help but hope for Dr.
