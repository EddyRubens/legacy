    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">To whom it may 
    concern:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">This is most probably 
    the last page of my diary. It is no longer safe for me to stay here. I’ll 
    tell you what happened: Yesterday evening I came ‘home’ late. I had been to 
    the pub with Lucas. When we walked to our rooms, we saw Steward in the 
    kitchen. He spoke to someone we both didn’t met before. That made us curious. 
    There are so many things going on here that we didn’t understand. We spoke 
    about that in the pub and now we had the possibility to reveal some of the 
    secrets. We thought. Well, to make a long story short: we found out that 
    Steward is indeed dealing with the pornographic industry. This mate of him, 
    the fellow we hadn’t met before, came to pick up some new memories. Steward 
    sold them for $5000 each! The bastard! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We tried to stay calm 
    but we couldn’t. Maybe it was the alcohol who let us leave too noisy. 
    Steward heard us leaving the kitchen entrance and grabbed us. What do you 
    think you were doing? he asked. I told him that we only wanted to have some 
    water after the alcohol we drank. It was the first thing on my mind. It was 
    ridiculous. We could of course get some water in our rooms as well. Steward 
    made something very clear. That we had all the reason for being afraid of 
    him. That our future was in his hands. He frightened me. Suddenly I believed 
    all the rumors. About Sonja, Hans and Heather and I’ve also heard that even 
    Rosanne has to fear for her life now. I have never felt so endangered in my 
    whole life. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">That’s why I’ve left. 
    If there’s one thing I can’t deal with, it is fear. You might think I’m a 
    coward but I’m not. This is just my way to survive. This is just my way of 
    taking my life in my own hands again. I have learned more during my time at 
    Braintec’s than I could ever dream of. Staying longer just gives me too much 
    stress and I have to learn for my exams. Those exams make it too difficult 
    to come up with another escape or solution. I gave Braintec some weeks but I 
    can’t give them my life, if you know what I mean. And I realy don't fancy 
    Tokyo. I don’t know what Lucas will do. I’ve left the same evening. I think 
    it’s no problem to keep the implant for a while. I’ll let Hamilton remove it 
    after my exams. Perhaps it helps me learning...</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I wish you all the 
    best and I hope you find a way to survive this project as well. Good luck at 
    take care,</span></p>
