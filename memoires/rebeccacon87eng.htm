	<span style="font-family:Arial">After reading Sonja's email, I felt bad that 
	I was just sitting around. I needed to find Carmen. I left my room and 
	headed to Adrian's. It was time to put the charm on and see what information 
	he could give me. When I reached his room I could hear him talking to 
	someone. It was Rosanne. They were talking about the letter that Sonja 
	obviously sent to all the members of Braintec. I was wondering what poor Dr. 
	Hamilton must have been thinking, knowing that he was screwed over by Dr. 
	Tachikawa. I couldn't really understand what they were saying, but I did 
	hear Rosanne ask Adrian who he would vote for, Dr. Hamilton or Dr. Tachikawa, 
	if he had to choose between the two. Then to my suprise with no pause for 
	thought I heard him say, <i>&quot;Kodjiro, He pays more for the job and gives me 
	more freedom.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I was disappointed in him. Dr. Hamilton has 
	given him a lot, too. Who exactly did he think allows him to work in that 
	crummy little office. If he only realized what a bastard Dr. Tachikawa was 
	maybe he would think twice. (Or at least take a moment to think!) I waited 
	for a quiet moment to walk in. I didn't want to interrupt any conversations 
	that might be useful to me. Unfortunately after that comment and an 
	unfinished sentence of Rosanne's the room became quiet. I walked to the 
	door, which was open and said <i>&quot;Knock, Knock!&quot;</i> while smiling. Rosanne 
	turned and looked at me. She was clearly not happy to see me. She walked 
	over to me and said, <i>&quot;Shouldn't you be laying down?&quot;</i> I politely 
	responded to her saying, <i>&quot;Why would I be laying down, Rosanne? It's still 
	early.&quot; </i>I could smell the liquor in her voice when she responded, <i>
	&quot;Because I heard you and your little friend in the 'Left Wing' decided to do 
	some landscaping.&quot; </i>She started to laugh and Adrian chuckled at her 
	landscaping joke. So, Carmen was in the 'Left Wing.' Rosanne just 
	unknowingly gave me all the information I was interested in. I looked at her 
	and Adrian and said, <i>&quot;You know... Your right. I think I do need to go lay 
	down. I'm feeling a little light headed.&quot;</i> </span></p>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">As I turned away from 
	the door, I heard Rosanne say something which I'm sure wasn't polite, and 
	her and Adrian both started laughing. I was laughing too, because I got what 
	I wanted in less than five minutes.</span><p>&nbsp;</p>
