    <span style="font-family: Arial">Another punch. Soesasji knows Hugo! Even 
    worse: Hugo knows Tachikawa! Rosanne was present, she doesn't know what to 
    think of this either. I couldn't sleep last night, it kept running around in 
    my head. I got up at 3 o'clock and started to write, trying to find out if I 
    went insane - or if there's more going on here.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Could it be it possible 
    that Hugo left that flyer on purpose in his trousers, so I would find it, 
    while doing the laundry? And if so, for what reason? Maybe he knew Tachikawa 
    already, professionally, knew about Braintec, and wanted to get rid of me 
    for a while so he could mess around with Sylvia without being disturbed. Or 
    perhaps it was a coincidence that I found that leaflet, at just the right 
    time for Hugo for me to go to Braintec.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Nevertheless, how did 
    he know Tachikawa? Well, they are both physicians, but that's all, and 
    apparently they have nothing else in common. I definitely have to ask 
    Soesasji what they were talking about that night. And where is Tachikawa 
    anyway?</span></p>
