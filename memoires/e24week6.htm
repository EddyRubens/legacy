    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Last 
    time it was peanuts. That’s why I didn’t feel ashamed to ask for another 
    upload from Adrian. <i>“You are lucky,”</i> he laughed, <i>“Some new 
    memories from Japan just arrived.”</i> I stood there staring with my mouth 
    open. Did he make a joke? <i>“You shouldn’t make a fuss about it,”</i> he 
    whispered within a second. He really meant what he was saying. <i>“If you 
    return within one hour, everybody is fast asleep. Then you get your upload 
    and I’ll try to register it on film.” </i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I couldn’t wish for 
    any better deal. A memory from Japan! I went for a walk round the research 
    centre and made sure I was back in time. Adrian was hesitating to start with 
    the upload right away. <i>“Let’s wait for a moment,”</i> he said. <i>“I 
    think I just heard somebody walking through the corridor.”</i> We both drank 
    a large cup of tea and I told him what I heard from Adelle. Adelle is an 
    adorable person, we decided, but she is too much devoted to Frank and Dr. 
    Hamilton.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We finished tea and 
    then it was time for the upload. <i>“What’s written on it?”</i> I asked. <i>
    “Have no idea,”</i> Adrian said. <i>“There is no description enclosed. But 
    if I’m not mistaken, we will find out soon!”</i> In no time we had prepared 
    everything. This memory seemed to enter much faster than usual. Everything 
    was flashing. I was located on a huge crossing, probably in Tokyo, and was 
    fascinated by all sorts of impressions. Behind, in front and beside of me, 
    Japanese were busy talking to each other. Neon-adds were flickering on 
    buildings surrounding the crossing. Happy sounds, beeps and the sound of 
    running engines of cars enforced the chaos. While everything appeared very 
    structured and according to an arranged plan. Then it was done! A deep sigh 
    and later I discovered the impossible. I did understand the Japanese 
    conversation of the people in the street! How come? I heard parts of 
    conversations about work, about a new computer-game and about the exchange 
    market. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Happily I walked through the studio and talked about my fantastic experience. 
    I was able to understand Japanese! Adrian pushed me back into my chair. <i>
    “Calm down a bit, will you,”</i> he hissed. <i>“Careful they can hear you!”</i> 
    Of course he was right although this upload gave me so much energy I could 
    hardly sit still. I tried my very best to stay calm. I noticed Adrian was 
    irritated. He stared at the small monitor producing calculations and fully 
    neglected me. Couldn’t wait any longer. I was just intending to leave, ‘coss 
    Adrian was obviously a bit angry at me, when the film was ready. Visions 
    were much clearer than before and exactly registered what I had seen. <i>“Yes!”</i> 
    Adrian shouted and he immediately got frightened of his own voice . We 
    looked at each other smiling. You simply cannot stop so much joy.</span></p>
