    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">After a long journey, I 
    shall spare you the details, I arrived deadly tired in Tokyo. I managed to 
    make a stopover in Brussels, to get some things from home. Home? It was 
    completely empty, and it was for sale. Hugo didn’t let the grass grow under 
    his feet. Fortunately he didn’t block our bank account, and I was delighted 
    to plunder the whole thing.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">In Tokyo I drove to a guest house by the 
    first taxi I saw. Such a hotel with sleeping cabins, I really didn’t feel 
    for that, and because I had a lot of money in my pocket, I wanted to be 
    brought to a quiet guest house just outside the city. I guess I have slept 
    there for three days at a stretch. I stood up at approximately five o’clock 
    in the morning, and let me drive to the city. At the station I bought an 
    English map (almost nobody speaks one word outdoors!) and I started to 
    search for the street number of the Braintec branch, which I saw at one of 
    Tachikawa’s notes. I couldn’t find it – maybe it was incorrect.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I didn’t stand still at 
    the risks I was going to take. I already had a long, actually since I 
    arrived in Portland, feeling I had to get my live back on track. I didn’t 
    know how, but it seemed as if through Braintec, and all the mysterious 
    things happening there, I had found a goal. And that goal, to solve the 
    intrigue, no matter how dangerous it would be, I had to succeed. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">At the head post 
    office I found three addresses of 'Kodjiri Tachikawa' in Tokyo. Two of them 
    where in working-class neighborhoods, and one of them was inside an 
    expensive condominium – and that seemed to be more appropriate for the vain 
    Tachikawa I knew. I have also called the American embassy, to cautiously 
    sound them out on him. If he has running business with the Pentagon, they 
    might know him. But no, sorry, never heard of him, but they did wanted to 
    know everything about me. I pretended to be an old friend on vacation in 
    Japan, and gave a false name and another hotel – the Holiday Inn, that must 
    exist in Tokyo, I assumed.</span></p>
