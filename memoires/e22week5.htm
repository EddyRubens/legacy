    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I don’t know what to 
    think of all these changes. It only gives me a hard time. My arms and legs 
    are covered by small wounds. I don’t have the slightest idea how they’ve 
    reached my body. Anyway, it can’t be small animals. I’ve checked for that. I 
    must have scratched the skin with my nails all by myself. And as a matter of 
    fact, it pleases me to scratch away the encrusted blood. I will be satisfied 
    if I don’t feel crusts anymore. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I’m 
    not the only one suffering from stress. I don’t exaggerate if I say that we 
    all are suffering from tensions. Sonja fiddles about with her hair and Steve 
    is playing drums on the table with his fingers. How irritating. I’m almost 
    getting a nervous break-down.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Nobody knows what 
    we’re up to and what is going to happen right now. I overheard that test 
    subjects are intending to leave from here. As an experienced assistant I do 
    not recommend anybody going home too soon. I try to pay little attention to 
    all tensions by telling jokes and thinking positively. Sometimes it helps, 
    sometimes it doesn’t work. Whether Braintec will survive I cannot guarantee 
    for sure. I feel the pressure myself too. Will Braintec survive without Dr. 
    Tachikawa? And how about the financial situation? Adelle could tell us more 
    about it. She had lunch with Dr. Hamilton and talked about the problem 
    dealing with money. There is equipment sufficient for about twenty days, 
    after that, most policies on subsidies stop lending money. ‘Coss then the 
    money we receive will be just a drop in the ocean. Dr. Hamilton fears the 
    worst scenario.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adelle told me she 
    felt sorry for him. The director is one of her best friends, calling him by 
    his first name right from the beginning. He knows her husband Donn very well. 
    Her husband? I didn’t know she had a husband! I didn’t show my astonishment 
    because we all wanted to listen to what Adelle was going to tell us. 
    Obviously she had an appointment with Dr. Hamilton. She suggested asking 
    Frank for help. Frank is an officer in the army and has the privilege to 
    know important persons. For years the Minister of Defense invested in all 
    sorts of developments which can be helpful sooner or later. It was Adelle’s 
    idea to contact Frank trying to solve our problem. She thinks he is willing 
    to support Braintec. Meanwhile I’m sure Dr. Hamilton gave him a call. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The idea Braintec will 
    discontinue within twenty days is a thing that leaves its mark on me. Where 
    will I go when it happens? I cannot return to Greenland and I do not fancy 
    Holland. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    only person, apparently, not suffering from stress and being sure of himself, 
    is Adrian. Since he got use of this instrument, testing precisely all sorts 
    of information, he cannot stop. He made a connection to his developed system 
    and is very pleased about the results. His original ambition to visualize 
    dreams is his hot item again. Maybe he can realize it by making use of this 
    instrument! I desperately wish he can continue working on it without 
    interruptions. So much talent. It would be a dead shame if he has to stop 
    using it.</span></p>
