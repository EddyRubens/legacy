    <span style="font-family: Arial"><b>How could I be so stupid to think it 
    would all be like a 007-movie? Yesterday night, at the terrace next to 
    Tachikawa’s, when I saw Rosanne sleeping, I definitely felt like the hero of 
    the story. I had probably overlooked ‘some details’ because of the 
    adrenaline. Details, which caused me a lot of trouble.</b>&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">The moment, when I looked behind the wall, 
    and saw Rosanne sleeping, I felt a hand with a piece of stinking textile 
    over my mouth and an arm that pulled me down. I couldn’t see who it was in 
    the dark, but when I felt the ground I slipped away, into unconsciousness. 
    After indefinite period of time I woke up, because someone was holding an 
    ammoniac capsule under my nose. I wildly slammed about me, but someone held 
    me tight and I couldn’t release myself.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">I seemed to be inside Tachikawa’s apartment. 
    It was still dark outside, but I saw it was getting lighter at the horizon 
    and the birds had already started singing. Opposite to me sat again that 
    Canadian, and Tachikawa filled some bowls with tea. I was furious, but 
    mostly at myself. <i>&quot;Well, Mrs. Boot Oil... what should we do with you?”</i> 
    he said. He wasn’t as friendly as he was in the cottage – when everything 
    seemed to go his way. <i>“What have you done with Rosanne?”</i> I asked 
    shortly<i>. “Don’t you worry about Rosanne madam, she had had a wonderful 
    night.”</i> The Canadian quickly looked inside the adjoining sleeping room. 
    So Rosanne was still lying there? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The Canadian opened the 
    suitcase which I had already seen when I stood at the sun roof. There where 
    uploads in it, at least it seemed so, but they had a different form, and 
    beneath a little plastic cap at the end there was a long needle. The man 
    took one, read the label, and removed the cap. I braced myself. The man 
    behind me holding me did so as well. <i>&quot;Mrs. Boot Oil,&quot;</i> the Canadian 
    said, <i>&quot;you might be honored, because you will be the first human being to 
    taste our latest experiment...&quot; &quot;No!&quot;</i> I shouted, and I resisted heavily, 
    but the man who was holding me kept me in a firm grip.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">The needle came closer to my face. <i>“You 
    know too much,”</i> the Canadian said, <i>“and that is not so clever.”</i> I 
    thought, and I thought so hard that my mind was hurting me. <i>&quot;Wait!&quot;</i> I 
    shouted. The needle stopped while its point already reached my nose. &nbsp;<i>&quot;Wait!&quot;</i> 
    I shouted again while I tortured my brains to come up with a plan. I laughed 
    sourly. <i>“If I already know as much as you think, why should I still 
    reject your plan?”&nbsp; </i>Tachikawa and the Canadian looked surprised at each 
    other. Then they looked at me again. <i>“Explain yourself!” </i>Tachikawa 
    snarled. I slowly and apparently calmly told them that I started to admire 
    their real work for Braintec more and more through time, as if I knew 
    everything about The Plan. And that I came to Tokyo to find out how I could 
    become part of that. </span></p>
