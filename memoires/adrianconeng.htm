    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I remember it still very well. In 
    the early eighty's of the last century, the municipal works of the city 
    where I lived was very busy to connect each house of the city to a thick 
    green cable. All over the city long trenches where made in the pavement to 
    unroll the long green cable. It was all meant for the connection of radio 
    and television. I dreamed already of further development. By means of a 
    phone, you could use various services on demand when your television was set 
    in the ceefax mode. Immediately I was overthinking the possibility of a huge 
    jukebox. Just enter a number on your phone and the music of your choice 
    sounds from your stereo without the need to walk to jour local record shop. 
    Now, over twenty years later the Internet makes all this possible. The only 
    disadvantage of this system was clear to me already. There was always the 
    need of a large device. One day, I heard the song of a band witch name I do 
    not remember anymore, but the name of the song was TV-o.d. The song made me 
    think of a cable direct connected to my body or brain, like a needle into a 
    vein. No use of heavy devices anymore. Clean connection by a cable, direct 
    access to the large data warehouse. I had to wait for more then twenty years 
    to see my futuristic dream come true. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Nowadays, in the lab of Braintec it 
    is all reality. Wireless, deviceless I walk trough my life. Sometimes in my 
    memory, sometimes in someone else's. An endless stream of events in memory 
    from myself or someone else's keeps me busy everyday. I listen to music that 
    is only heard by the composer and was not ever released. Video clips, 
    exceeding the wildest fantasy's I download them directly from the 
    choreographers mind. My boldest dreams, I upload them to my friends and they 
    send me immediately the necessary feedback. I do care not to use the chip 
    the whole day. I have to produce my own memory's too you know. Living my own 
    life, costs time anyhow. My spare time I divide on a fifty-fifty base 
    between myself and what the chip offers me. I have to make choices. The 
    memory of one person who is as old as I am is enough to fill up all the rest 
    of my life. I also want to be selective with the memories I share with 
    others. Sometimes I think that this is egoistic. Then I ask myself: &quot;is this 
    memory useful to anyone else?&quot; Sometimes, memories are so strictly private, 
    that I cannot bear the thought of someone else looking over my shoulder. 
    However, I know Braintec is working on a policy for the use of thoughts of 
    that kind. I better do not think about the consequences. Maybe in future I 
    have to upload memories even if I do not want it. If it appears that I will 
    lose the use of the chip, I do not know what my choice will be. Not being 
    able to use the possibilities of Braintec's device anymore is a thought I 
    can hardly bear.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Last week I discovered that my task 
    as a test subject at Braintec provided a nice follow up. I suggested that it 
    should have to be made possible that the thoughts en memories somebody had 
    put on the server could be printable. The writing of memoirs and articles 
    should then become a lot easier. The word-processor should become of lesser 
    need. The writing of this module in the program is trusted to me. Isn't it 
    nice! It gives me the possibility to use my talents as a programmer and it 
    also gives me a peek at the working of the chip and its software. The 
    recording of somebody's dreams will be a very simple task. When you wake up, 
    you just simply print out your dream and you know everything exactly as you 
    dreamed it. It is also useful to send your dream data by e-mail to a dream 
    explainer. An exact copy of your dream. What you don't read, you did not 
    dream. But: what is written there you really dreamed! A next possibility is 
    the recording of your thoughts and memories in a video format. It will be 
    possible to play the movie of your memories on any personal computer. 
    However, I think, that the technical possibilities are still covered in the 
    future. </font></p>
