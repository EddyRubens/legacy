    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The atmosphere seems to 
    be right. Braintec is a smaller company than I suspected. But it is growing 
    quite fast. Most of the employees I’ve spoken are working here since two 
    months or even shorter. Lots of people will be hired in the nearby future. 
    Especially test subjects. It is the companies’ intention to double the 
    amount of employees within three months. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">I have just finished 
    my first tests. There were two intelligent tests and some kind of a 
    psychology test. Some parts of the tests are difficult for me. My stock of 
    words, for example, is very limited. Therefore I’m afraid my I.Q. will turn 
    out to be similar to my shoe size. The American language just isn’t my 
    mother tongue and they don’t have Dutch versions of the tests in stock. The 
    test psychologist seems to understand my problem. She takes more time for 
    the tests than she usually does. This afternoon we discussed the story of my 
    life. She wanted to know everything about my childhood and the relations 
    I’ve got. My emotional response on certain situations is one of her favorite 
    subjects. Sometimes I gave her the answers I thought she would love to hear. 
    She seems to be satisfied in general. At least she smiles at me every now 
    and then. But that could also be a part of her duties. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">To comfort me. </span></b></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Tonight we’re eating 
    Indian food. It will be delivered in about thirty minutes. Until then I’ve 
    got some spare time to sit here and write a bit. Test subjects are supposed 
    to stay in the building during their testing days. Staying inside for three 
    days; do they have any idea what that means to me? I lived almost 
    permanently in the open air while I was still in Greenland! </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jessica, 
    the test psychologist, understands my need for fresh air. </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">She invited me to walk 
    outside with her during the breaks. She needs nicotine, but she doesn’t want 
    to smoke her cigarettes in the lounge where everyone smokes. A huge blue 
    dense irritates the eyes and makes it almost impossible to see each other, 
    she warned me. I am curious how that will be during dinnertime. If there’s 
    one thing I can’t stand, it’s eating inside smoky places. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Everything 
    tastes awful then. After these testing days I can eat wherever and whatever 
    I want. I can’t imagine me eating her</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">e</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"> 
    at free will. </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">A 
    change of scenery is important for anyone, isn’t it? Though a lot of 
    employees seem to prefer eating here, Jessica told me. They see food as a 
    necessary interruption of their work that must be consumed as quickly as 
    possible. It doesn’t matter if it is pizza, Chinese food, a Mexican wrap or 
    some deep fried dish they heated in the microwave. They hardly ever look at 
    there food at all because they consume television at the same time. Within a 
    few minutes I can see it for myself. I am curious. This environment is so 
    different from what I’m used to. </span>

    my eyes on everything.</span></p>
