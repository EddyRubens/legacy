    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I don’t have diabetes, 
    hepatitis, hyperuricaemia or AIDS. Jessica started our first talk of the day 
    reading the outcome of the blood- and urine tests. <i>“Now, what do you 
    think about that?”</i> she asked me. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial"><i>“Great!”</i> I answered a 
    bit bewilderd. What a silly question. She winked at me and closed my file. I 
    would love to skim through that map. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">
    Maybe there’s something to read about tonight’s decision. I informed 
    tactically about the results or the other tests, but Jessica remained 
    silent. Even if it was just a little corner of the veil, I would be grateful 
    if she lifted it. Well, perhaps was her wink a sign of good effort. </span>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">My wandering about 
    the test results were interrupted for the next test. I had to wear those 
    adhesives on my head and on the back of my neck again, attached to some kind 
    of reading devise. </span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">An 
    E.E.G. perhaps, I’m not sure. The first test was very probably an 
    association test. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I had to say the 
    first words or short sentences that came in my mind at the sign of 
    particular photos and drawings. Sometimes these words were in Dutch, or even 
    in Danish. Interruptions during the test were not advisable, because they 
    only wanted to know the meaning of these foreign words when the test was 
    finished. An assistant had written down all my associations. <i>“What does 
    do-sjkordi mean?”</i> he asked me deadly serious. They had to come up with 
    the picture of a vague white painted stripe before I remembered saying 
    “douchegordijn”, Dutch for shower curtain. This confusion of tongues went on 
    for a while. It gave me the opportunity to change my associations, if I 
    thought it might turn to my advantage.</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">We could hardly take 
    a break before we went on with the following test. Those translations took 
    too much time and we were far behind schedule. The following test was the 
    weirdest test I’ve ever done. Maybe that had to do with the strange 
    atmosphere caused by the association test. It seemed to be some kind of 
    obedience test. I had to wear those same adhesives combined with a little 
    machine attached to my back. They placed me in a room filled with objects. I 
    was alone in this weird dollhouse and I heard my commands through the 
    intercom. There were most likely a dozen of people laughing at me behind the 
    big mirror. Don’t worry. You’re doing fine! I said to myself. <i>
    “Three steps to the right, please.” “Pick up the yellow cube and put it on 
    the orange square.”</i> It was hard not to become completely nuts. Why this 
    bizarre test, I kept on asking myself. I guess it was the best to do exactly 
    what they asked me to do, without asking questions. It’s wouldn’t surprise 
    me if that was the meaning of this test. To find out if I’m able to obey 
    silly orders without an explanation. </span></p>
