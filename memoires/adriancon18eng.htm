    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The answer came this 
    same week. Rosanne and I are enjoying the “freedom” of taking uploads 
    secretly. In the evening or at night we sneak to my workspace and go through 
    the whole archive. Until last evening. Rosanne’s upload was amazing. She 
    couldn’t stop talking about it. I worked myself into a sweat to get some 
    images. First it didn’t work, but suddenly I’ve got the whole upload on 
    screen. I yelled of satisfaction. A bit overenthusiastic perhaps, because 
    the door opened and that wasn’t caused by the draught. It was Mr. Hamilton 
    himself. It frightened the shit out of me. This was the end. We were like a 
    bunch or children caught while playing with matches at the schoolyard and 
    the teacher suddenly behind you. My heart skipped three pulses and 
    immediately repaired the damage. My throat swelled. Rosanne kept clear and 
    she convinced Hamilton that it was all her idea. Her plan. She said that she 
    forced me more or less to give her an upload. That it was all her fault. She 
    kept talking and talking and tried to convince Hamilton that it was all for 
    science. For the development of my images-machine, dreams on Video. It didn’t 
    help at all and she actually told more than – according to me – she had to. 
    I wanted to keep my progress for myself for a while, to be able to use the 
    lab without disturbance. Eventually I am far from ready copying the M-stores, 
    software and product information.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Hamilton wasn’t 
    impressed. He only looked at Rosanne and I wonder if he understood my part 
    in it. He was only angry at Rosanne and said that her implant would be 
    removed and that she could already buy a ticket to go back to Amsterdam. 
    <i>“You can play further there! But not here anymore”</i>. He turned and walked 
    through the door which he slammed shut. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Rosanne’s response 
    surprised me. She quickly dried her tears which I think she is able to put 
    in on command, and took the glass of water I reached her. She is a quick 
    thinker, obviously, because she asked me to give her a phone and immediately 
    called the airport. With the phone in one hand she crabbed a flight ticket 
    out of her pocket with the other. But she didn’t make a reservation for a 
    flight to Amsterdam, but for Tokyo. <i>“What the...?”</i> I asked. <i>&quot;Kodjiro gave me 
    that ticket. To use in times of need. I think this is emergency.”</i> Her flight 
    departed at four o’clock. She had hardly enough time to pack some necessary 
    things. She asked me to take care of the rest of her belongings. <i>“I will 
    bring them to a safer place, where you can pick them up later.” </i> </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">After I brought 
    Rosanne to the airport I stepped into my car to drive back to Braintec. I 
    still had to………. Well what did I have to. It was time to get organized. In 
    Portland it seems to be the story of the ten little ducks. Shall I be the 
    next duck? What do I have to finish before I leave. If I leave. I decide to 
    wait. I shall contact Kodjiro and Jessica tomorrow. Then Rosanne will be 
    arrived and maybe Sonja is in the picture again. First I have to get some 
    sleep and then to the lab to get things clear as soon as possible. Cleaning 
    up the whole thing. Making back-ups and send them to Elgin, rent a locker 
    here in Portland. Enough to do. It is half past seven if I disturb the 
    silence of early morning at Braintec’s car park. I am deadly tired.</span></p>
