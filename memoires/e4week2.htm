    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Steward is of the 
    opinion that I am now a cyborg. Because my body, without free will as an 
    intermediary, can be directly linked to binary codes or something. Strange 
    man, that Steward. I don’t like his face and the way he comes across. He’s a 
    boring man who seems to live only for his work. Fully committed to</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial"> 
    the research. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">There’s not much else 
    that appears to interest him and he has absolutely no sense of humor. Only 
    when he talks about the future of humanity, he seems somewhat radiant. In 
    his world we have already evolved past the human stage and we’ll be looking 
    for alternative living environments in space soon. He talks with so much 
    passion about this that I hardly dare to talk back. That would be like 
    forcing reality on a child that believes its teddy bear is alive. Even 
    grown-ups have the right to dream. Especially grown-ups; they probably need 
    it more. Sometimes I doubt Steward’s intelligence, although his knowledge 
    and education prove that he’s way more clever than I am of course. But he 
    comes across a little too simple sometimes. I find him boring. A real jerk.

    guess I might as well be proud myself. </span></b></p>
