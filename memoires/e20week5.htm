    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Fortunately no deviations 
    were seen on Kathy’s brain-scan. Yet Dr. Hamilton decided that it would be 
    better to take out her implant ‘coss she was dying to go home. The fact that 
    her father would cause any more problems seemed more reasonable to me though. 
    He asked Sheila to assist during the operation, now that Dr. Tachikawa is 
    not here. <i>“By the way, where is Kodjiro?”</i> I asked. <i>“Don’t pretend 
    you do not know!”</i> The director growled at me. My mouth opened through 
    astonishment. Never ever had I seen Dr. Hamilton falling-out to somebody 
    like this. Specially not to me, in no way. And I honestly didn’t have the 
    slightest idea where Dr. Tachikawa could be. I hadn’t even noticed that he 
    was gone! It’s not the first time I don’t see him for days. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;According to myself, she really has no 
    idea,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> Sheila said. How kind of 
    her to throw herself into the breach. I nodded my head acknowledging, 
    looking at Dr. Hamilton wondering why. <i>“Walk with me, will you, please...”</i> 
    Sheila ordered and pushed me gentle out of the office. <i>“Dr. Hamilton is 
    much too busy to give you any explanations right now.”</i> She poured me a 
    glass of water when we were in her room. <i>“Dr. Tachikawa is in Tokyo at 
    the moment,”</i> she explained while she put a glass of water exactly in 
    front of me. <i>“He called this morning to tell me that. The whole week he 
    was been missing and we were wondering if he would come back to us. Tensions 
    between him and the director have improved very strongly.”</i> It did not 
    strike me at all. The incident with Davel obviously gave me some 
    distractions…</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Maybe such a distance will clear the sky a 
    bit,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> I thought out loud. <i>“I 
    doubt it,”</i> Sheila answered. <i>“I’m afraid that too much has been 
    spoiled already. Dr. Hamilton lost his confidence in Dr. Tachikawa. Also in 
    you, by the way. When you didn’t show up for that meeting this week, he 
    thought you had gone with him. We have been looking for you all over the 
    place. Where were you actually?” “Oh well, I uh, I was in town. I completely 
    forgot our appointment.”</i> It seemed to be wiser not to tell her that I 
    was in bed with Davel. Having finished a bottle of vodka again and massaging 
    his back and nothing else. Sheila grinned sheepishly. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><b><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;You cannot trust Dr. Tachikawa,&quot;</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    she warned me. <i>“It is better not to be involved with that man too much.”</i> 
    Steward entered the room and told me that they were ready to remove Kathy’s 
    implant. Sheila shook hands with me when she said goodbye, as if she wanted 
    to seal our words. </span></b></p>
