    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As I was leaving the 
    facility to meet Carmen, I saw Adelle and some man visiting in the 
    Communion-Room. She was petting and playing with a small gray dog. The poor 
    thing looked as though it needed to be let outside. It was going crazy! So 
    was Adelle. She was treating it like it was a child, saying things like <i>'My 
    little Dinky-Winkie missed his Mama!'&nbsp; 'Where the Dinky-Poo?'</i> And my 
    personal favorite, <i>'Does Dinky-Dinky need to do the Dooty-Dooty for Mama? 
    Yes, he does! Yes, he does!'</i> I love Bruce to no end, but I hope someone 
    would come over and kick me if I ever start talking like that! After seeing 
    Adelle and that loud and annoying dog it makes me realize how much I miss 
    Bruce. It has been 5 weeks since I have seen him. I wonder if he thinks I 
    gave him away. But, that reminds me...Why does Adelle get to have her dog 
    come visit? I was told absolutely no animals were allowed here.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">On my way out the 
    door, Davel stopped me. He pushed me up against the wall and said, <i>&quot;Have 
    you seen the beauty?&quot; &quot;The beauty?&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;Yes, I am the beast 
    searching for the beauty. She is the only one who can break the spell the 
    old witch cast upon me! Have you see her?&quot; </i>The only thing I could think 
    of was..'<i>Gee, wonder what Disney movie this guy just watched.'</i> Then I 
    replied; <i>&quot;Yes Davel, I have seen the beauty! The old witch cast a spell 
    on her as well, turning her into a gray hairy monster. She is being held 
    captive. You must go rescue her. She is in the Communion-Room. Go!&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He ran off down the 
    hall. Sometimes I wonder if he is just acting totally loony or is he really 
    screwed up? Either way, he hopefully will keep people busy enough that they 
    won't miss me or Carmen. The test subjects are supposed to write down when 
    we are leaving the facility and where we are going. I just left.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It is 3:00 and I am 
    waiting in the Japanese Gardens. I have not seen Carmen yet. I hope she was 
    not caught leaving. I hope she is OK! I think I should walk </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">around a bit and see if 
    I can find her.</span></p>
