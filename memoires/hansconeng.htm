    <span style="font-family: Arial">Hurrah, it is finally becoming real. It is 
    already two months ago that I decided to participate in De Gele Rijder. The 
    presentation was so convincing that I applied immediately. I don’t dare to 
    undergo the MESI-operation. That implant looked so big. The MSI might be 
    better for me. After then I had an eye-operation that throw a spanner in the 
    works. But well, that is over and done with and I am recovered enough for 
    the Braintec-operation. It is arranged with my boss that I free for six 
    weeks starting next weekend. Braintec has sent me the message that it is 
    definitely taking place. The flight ticket for Sunday was attached. I am 
    ready now for the big adventure. What will happen with my memories? Because 
    of Braintec I have focused more on my own memories lately. My memories of 
    all the nice things I experienced and all the beautiful things I have seen 
    are actually my most precious possession. It is so many, so rich, so 
    variously shaped. A lot of what happened a long time ago is still clear in 
    my mind. So I already recall every day. The packing of my luggage for 
    example, gives me immediately images from previous travels. Visiting the 
    United States seems pretty special to me. It is a country I have heard so 
    much from but where I’ve never been. Based on earlier memories I built an 
    image of how it would probably be there. The memory gives me impressions 
    from where I judge new situations as well.&nbsp; That is dangerous because it 
    brings prejudices. Therefore I go as blanc as possible into this new 
    adventure. I will find out soon enough what’s going to happen. Braintec is 
    such a trustful organization that I don’t have to worry about any risks.</span></p>
