    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    is fabulous getting along with Dr. Tachikawa. He is so sweet and very kind. 
    I’m afraid that I’m totally in love again. I shouldn’t imagine things of 
    course. He isn’t the kind of man to commit to someone. But that doesn’t 
    matter. I fully enjoy the times with him. What else can I wish for?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We made a boat-trip 
    together. Sailing across the ocean. It was so romantic! There were many 
    seagulls joining the small boat. Kodjiro had bought a special cookie for 
    gulls and together we tried to feed the birds from our hands. We offered the 
    food stretching our arms. Some naughty seagulls managed to snatch away the 
    food. It was super. The whole afternoon we spent together and I can tell for 
    sure that I didn’t long for an upload. Not just for one second. I just didn’t 
    think about it. This event was even better. This was real. And besides, an 
    upload would never give the same expectations. Apart from relishing the 
    boat-trip afterwards, I can easily speculate for hours about any possible 
    consequences of this trip today. The way Kodjiro laughed at me. He 
    definitely enjoyed himself a lot. Could he possibly be in love with me?
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After the boat-trip we 
    had dinner together. Going out for dinner in Japan is very common, sometimes 
    even three times a day. But this time was special to me. I think Kodjiro 
    knows exactly what I like best, for he had ordered a few delicious dishes. 
    The eggplant stuffed with miso was absolutely the best. After dinner we went 
    to some kind of bar. If I had not followed Kodjiro, I could have never found 
    the place. The small street didn’t give the impression that some kind of bar 
    was situated in here and from the outside it looked like any of the 
    neighboring houses. The only difference was that more shoes and slippers 
    were stored in front of the sliding entrance.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Kodjiro ordered some 
    Tempura and a few cocktails. He ordered three at the same time, only for me! 
    I think he wanted me to get drunk! He drank sake himself. I like sake 
    prepared into food, but I don’t like it straight. He also knew. The 
    cocktails tasted just like lemonade and I finished them in no time. Still 
    there wasn’t less alcohol in it. </span></p>
