    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Rosanne had a hard time, 
    now she's back from Holland for those presentations. She was thrown out of 
    some cafe where she was with Adrian, and we even had the police on our 
    doorstep. I already thought that she was involved in some way with Tachikawa, 
    the way she sometimes stared at him... I think he's a sneek if you ask me - 
    with that frozen smile on his face. No, especially concerning the latest 
    developments, I think he has something to hide.</span></p>

    <span style="font-family: Arial">We have a new test subject around here, 
    Lucas, very kind, but a bit murky if you ask me. But I might be seeing 
    ghosts everywhere at this moment.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">I will keep an eye on Tachikawa. He isn't 
    around so often, but I'm trying to find out if he treats me differently than 
    the others, but I didn't notice find anything. The same smile, the same 
    reserve.</span></p>

    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The tests are going fine 
    and I am allowed to go to the left wing. I do what I'm asked for and I just 
    go with the flow. But suddenly I start to have these very intense dreams. 
    Yesterday I saw Jessica in my dream, entering my room, and she undressed, 
    routinely, as if she didn't notice me. When she took off her sweater I saw a 
    hole in her body at the place where her heart should be. And inside that 
    hole there was a bright blue, cold light. I looked at the light and I felt 
    being pulled into it completely. Then I woke up, with the blanket lying on 
    the floor.</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">&nbsp;</span></p>
