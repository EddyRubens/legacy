    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">Slept well 
    and had a nice breakfast. This day is reserved for the temples. Public 
    transport is going well. I have a good map of Tokyo. Where we walk we count 
    the streets and I use my compass. During an earlier journey to China I have 
    learned to cross streets without readable street signs. The temples are a 
    visit more than worth. I have seen Buddhist temples in several other 
    countries but the Japanese are rather different. A monk is trying to sell us 
    a small Buddha sculpture. It is a nice sculpture but heavy to carry with us. 
    To get rid of him I say a price far below his’. He goes down with his price, 
    I’m not going up with mine. I am very surprised when he finally agrees with 
    my price. Now we have to buy it. After the temples we saw some more of the 
    city and visited two galleries. A lot of interesting art again. <br>
    <br>
    Back in the hotel Heather says that there is something wrong with the Buddha. 
    The head seems to be screwed on it. We screw it off. The inside of the 
    Buddha is hollow. Like a real Buddha he has released himself from 
    unnecessary thoughts, I say to Heather. There is something in it, Heather 
    answers. With a pincer she picks a small paper out of it and opens it. She 
    fears the text. </span></p>

    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic" lang="nl">
    Be careful, danger. Braintec knows a lot more than we thought. They also 
    know where you are right now. It is good that you haven’t chosen that hotel. 
    Braintec shall continue following you and try to bring you to a place where 
    they can toxic you to exanimate you. Try to avoid being brought to somewhere. 
    If someone tries to make contact you choose the location. As long as you’re 
    not entering Braintecspace there is no danger. If you make an appointment 
    with Brainteccers you connect your laptop again. There is no risk if you 
    connect that to their equipment yourself. Good luck, Paul.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">Heather says 
    that Braintec has to be an influential organization if Paul warns us this 
    way. But we are warned now and Paul’s order seems to be performable. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">It is very 
    nice again in our guesthouse during the evening. There is again another 
    artist who has a temporary atelier there. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">&nbsp;<map name="FPMap0"><area target="_self" href="hanscon10eng.htm" shape="rect" coords="3, 4, 42, 40"><area target="_self" href="hanscon11eng.htm" shape="rect" coords="43, 5, 81, 40"><area target="_self" href="hanscon12eng.htm" shape="rect" coords="82, 4, 113, 40"></map><img border="0" src="images/pijltjes.gif" align="right" usemap="#FPMap0" width="114" height="41"></span></p>
