      <span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">PORTLAND</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> 
      – </span>Jefferson Joe Hamilton can’t talk to me when I arrive on a 
      Tuesday morning in early September. The Braintec Research Center is busy 
      preparing a new schedule for the test subjects to come.<span style="font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">
      </span>So I sit silently in a chair opposite him, taking in the 
      Transcranial Server, the M-stores and the marvelous little implants that 
      he laid out for me. Moments later he springs out of his seat, collecting 
      the notes and transparencies. “It’s been a hectic morning,” he says 
      hurriedly, explaining that he forgot his notes at home, as we head 
      downstairs to pick up some slides. Realizing now that he’s left something 
      in his office, Hamilton dashed back up the stairs two at a time. Within 
      seconds he races down again, and we’re off to drink some coffee in a 
      relaxation room. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Although it comes with a certain amount of chaos, 
      such abundant energy has served 64-year-old Hamilton well in his prolific 
      career as neurosurgeon, psychiatrist and director of Braintec. His 
      groundbreaking research on the Transcranial Stimulator, coupled with 
      advances in functional brain imaging, has elevated the field – and its 
      investigators- to respectability. The neuroscientist leads about 12 
      researchers and calls their mission to explain memories “one of the major 
      unsolved problems of modern science.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">During his early years, Hamilton imbibed embassy life 
      from Kansas City to Cambridge to Amsterdam, Ottawa and Japan. Initially he 
      wanted to be a cosmologist, but he realized that his gifts were not in 
      high-level mathematics. So he studied psychiatry instead. Two books 
      sparked his interest in nervous system computations, one of which gave a 
      physicist’s perspective on the brain. Its author, Paul Muller, became one 
      of Hamilton’s advisers at the Oregon Health Sciences University, where 
      Hamilton earned a doctorate in neurosurgery.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Along the way, his work with the Transcranial 
      Stimulator has helped elucidate how neurons compute. Hamilton was among 
      the few to challenge the prevailing metaphor equating the wiring of the 
      human brain with the circuitry of a computer. Instead of accepting the 
      idea that memories results from the combined action of billions of 
      neurons, each a relatively simple component, he asserted that individual 
      neurons carry out complex computations. Indeed, mounting evidence shows 
      how neural cells function not only as a network of linear threshold 
      devices, relaying electrical pulses or not, but also as individuals 
      working autonomously and adaptively. Neurons can add signals, subtract 
      them, multiply, divide, filter and average them, among other functions. 
      “The computational toolbox of individual neurons dwarfs the elements 
      available to today’s electronic circuit designers,” Hamilton says. “We 
      must keep that in mind while we try to find out how our memories are 
      stored.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton seems to understand remembering at the 
      neuronal level. So far he has issued several bold and controversial 
      hypotheses that describe how neurons correlated with memories may be 
      identified. The first pertains to the existence of an oscillation and 
      synchronization pattern among groups of neurons during a recall. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Not all leading memory researchers think that 
      locating specific neuron groups is the key. Norton and his longtime 
      collaborator Graham Harris, now at the University of California, see 
      limits. “Even if we would come down with a small list (of neurons),” 
      Harris says, “we wouldn’t understand why some neurons contribute to the 
      whole experience of remembering and others don’t. The apparent differences 
      seem insufficient to explain the metaphysical gap.” Harris and Norton 
      favor characterizing broader neural processes to account for properties of 
      memories – namely, differentiation (neural complexity) and integration (functional 
      clustering). That is, and each is a unified whole that can’t be subdivided. 
      These two properties, they contend, can be measured to gauge whether a 
      group of neurons is contributing to recollecting experience. The 
      combination of neural complexity and functional clustering forms the basis 
      of their so-called dynamic core hypothesis. Before a theory can take hold, 
      he and Norton propose that new physical laws or principles will need to be 
      discovered. That’s because memory, they say, is an irreducible phenomenon, 
      much like space, time and gravity. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Hamilton acknowledges the difficulties in developing 
      a neurophysiologic explanation of subjective experience but thinks 
      neuroscience will eventually solve the puzzle. “Whether we will ever have 
      a satisfactory reductionist account, like we think we do of life, remains 
      an open question,” he says. Then he points to a bit of wisdom from 
      renowned English biologist J.B.S. Haldane. “The universe is not only a 
      strange place,” Hamilton paraphrases, “but a stranger place than we can 
      imagine.”</p>
