    There were several physical tests on today’s schedule, including a full 
    brain scan. They pushed me inside a sealed tube, what I found terrifying. I 
    have always been quite claustrophobic. The idea of not being able to get out 
    quickly makes me anxious. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">I had to 
    ly down quitly while I feld the implus of getting out as fast as possible.
    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">That restlessness made it difficult 
    not to move. I would prefer to have three teeth extracted by an unknown 
    dentist while that would really hurt unlike this scan. Perhaps I acted 
    childish; I feel ashamed when I think of my behavior. Fortunately I could 
    fully cooperate during the remaining tests so they didn’t have to take extra 
    time for me anymore. Even the research with the Transcranial Stimulator, a 
    sophisticated instrument that stimulated specific areas of the brain, went 
    on easily. Everybody knows the little hammer with which a doctor ticks 
    against the knee to test the reflexes. This Transcranial Stimulator works 
    quite similar. Suddenly my left forearm moved up or I felt an irritating 
    itch under my foot. Furthermore I had to jog on the exerciser while they 
    made an E.E.G. and they took another blood sample. I guess the test results 
    are fine. They are very seares of giving feedback, even if I ask for it. “<i>You’re 
    doing fine, babe!</i>” is what I get as an answer al the time. “<i>Don’t you 
    worry</i>.” </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">The test results 
    will be discussed in the team meeting tomorrow afternoon. They’ll let me 
    know the results of the negotiations the same evening. I’ll have to leave 
    the Research </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">Center</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> the morning after if I’m found unsuitable for the job or I’ll have to 
    sign a definitive contract in which I fully comply with Braintec’s 
    experiments. In the last case I’ll be surgically operated the next morning. 
    Then they will saw a little hole in my scull through which they can place 
    the implant. </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
Arial">I’m not sure what I prefer, probably a positive outcome. For the stupid 
    reason I don’t know what else to do. That’s a reason I can’t accept but I 
    haven’t got a better one. So I lay my destiny in Braintec’s hands and wait 
    for the outcome. In the meantime I’ll try to make the tests as good as 
    possible hoping that I’ll find out what I want in time. To behold the 
    possibility to make my own decisions.</span></p>
