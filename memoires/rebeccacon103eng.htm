	As I sat in my room, my stomach ached from all that was happening. I felt as 
	though I was looking through a window at my life, but with an 'Alice in 
	Wonderland' effect. There were a bundle of unusual and shady characters, 
	surreal surroundings, and nothing really seemed to make any sense. I was 
	just the stupid girl who was too curious.</span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	I packed my suitcase with only my most important belongings (including the 
	Band-Aid box) and shoved the suitcase under my bed. I wanted to be ready to 
	go as soon as Agent Davis and Mr. Isakova's friend's arrived. I planned on 
	emailing them later to find out their exact location, and ask if there is 
	anything I can do to help.
	By the time I got everything packed, I realized how restless I was. I was 
	fuming with anger and was contemplating a confrontation with Dr. Hamilton.
	<br>
	I looked at the clock and noticed it was 12:45am. I knew Dr. Hamilton would 
	most likely be awake, so I headed to his office. </span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	Along the way I saw Rosanne in the Communion-Room. She was talking to one of 
	the new test subjects. She was a petite Asian girl, named, Mei, who had 
	porcelain looking skin. I had seen her around a few times. From what I 
	heard, she was Sally's new roommate.
	When Rosanne was done talking to her, she turned towards me. She slowly 
	walked up to me, obviously knowing what she was going to say, and gave me a 
	snide look. <i>&quot;You know,&quot; </i>she said, <i>&quot;If I'm not mistaken, pretty soon you're 
	going to be left here...all alone.&quot; </i>I asked her what she meant by her remark, and she said, 
	<i>&quot;That just means you 
	won't have your little Latin fireball to protect you. I know people...and I 
	can have all sorts of things done to you. Remember your little puppet 
	extraction? That was a lot of fun,...wasn't it!&quot; </i>She laughed and walked away 
	after that comment.</span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	Was she threatening me? What was her problem with me anyway? Just to make 
	things clear, I love Carmen. She is my best friend. But Lord knows I don't 
	need her for protection. Rosanne obviously didn't know who she was dealing 
	with. She obviously didn't know I knew people too! 
	I followed Rosanne in hopes to catch her with her hand in the cookie jar, so 
	to speak. She ended up going to the little room Adrian called his office. I 
	stood outside the door listening to her plead with him. She was asking 
	Adrian to give her an upload.<br>
	An upload? That must have been what Adrian took the other day under his 
	jacket...M-stores. I waited for a few more minutes then heard him putting 
	things into place. <br>
	I quickly headed for Dr. Hamilton's office. If Rosanne wanted to play rough, 
	she just got the bull!</span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	I knocked on Dr. Hamilton's office door. He was sitting at his desk reading 
	something. <i>&quot;Rebecca, what are you doing up so late?&quot;</i> he said as he opened 
	the door. <br>
	I barged in without an offer and sat down on his leather couch. I cupped my 
	hands over my face and turned on the fake tears. I was hoping that Dr. 
	Hamilton still had some feelings for me and decided to play on them.<br>
	<i>&quot;Oh, Dr. Hamilton I feel silly for even coming here but I don't think Sheila 
	likes me much, and I have no one else to talk to.&quot; </i>He sat down beside me and put his hand on my shoulder. 
	<i>&quot; Is there something 
	I can do to help you?&quot; </i>he said to me. I knew he obviously felt something 
	still or he would have referred me to Sheila in spite of the comment I made 
	about her. <i>&quot;Well,&quot; </i>I continued. <i>&quot;I was just out for a little stroll because I have been 
	worried about Carmen and couldn't sleep....and...I went down to the 
	Communion-Room to get a soda....and Rosanne was there.&quot; </i>He looked at me like he wasn't sure what I was implying. 
	<i>&quot;And...&quot; </i>he said.
	I stood up and said, <i>&quot;Maybe I shouldn't be here...I should go.&quot;
	</i>He grabbed my hand and assured me that if something was bothering me, he 
	wanted to know so that he could take care of it.
	I was feeling a little guilty for playing with his feelings, but then 
	reminded myself how he hasn't done much to help Carmen, Megan, Jenna or 
	Simone. 
	I sat back down and continued the crying act saying Rosanne has been really 
	mean to me, and she has threatened me. I added in a few juicy details, which 
	never happened, and figured it would always be her word against mine. But 
	the icing on the cake was when I mentioned that she was getting uploads from 
	Adrian in his office. I told him I saw him doing it just minutes ago when I 
	made a wrong turn down the hall. </span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	He stood me up and said he would take care of the Rosanne situation and I 
	wouldn't be upset by her anymore. Then he excused himself to some business 
	he needed to attend to. I thanked him for listening to me and pretended to 
	head back to my room.<br>
	I was positive that the business he had to attend to was Rosanne getting the 
	upload. This was a show too good to miss so I decide to follow.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;"><br>
