    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I’d like to pass on 
    today. Because of the seizure yesterday I was already feeling less splendid, 
    but now things are really wrong. The slightest upset brings me to tears. 
    Just now, in the test room, when they asked me if I would go through a 
    second session. A simple question that I could have answered with a simple 
    ‘no’. I had a massive lump in my throat as I saw Dr. Watson walk toward me. 
    From the look on his face it was already clear what he wanted. He was 
    probably as embarrassed as me when the tears came. Instead of waiting for an 
    answer to escape from my sobbing he told me I could have the rest of the day 
    off. But he did ask me to report to Jessica.
    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Now I’ve been hanging around in my 
    temporary room all afternoon. After some insisting I was finally allowed to 
    close the curtain.
    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">The jig-saw doesn’t interest me 
    anymore and I don’t feel like 
    reading either. Nothing interests me really. I’m more than fed up. Not just being 
    here at Braintec, but everything. I wish I could fall into a deep sleep and 
    never wake up again. Yuk, I feel miserable. I could stop taking part in the 
    project of course but the alternatives don’t seem very appealing as well. 
    What have I really achieved in life? Why haven’t I been successful, in 
    anything? I see myself as a puny creature, one that whines on top of 
    everything. My self pity merely makes me angry. I’m fed up but I can’t find 
    the strength to get up and take control of my situation and change things.
