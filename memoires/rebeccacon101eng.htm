	I sat in my room until 7:45pm. I couldn't wait any longer so I decided to 
	head over to Thomas' room. Just when I was arriving, I noticed Thomas and 
	Jerry coming from the opposite way. I smiled and said <i>'Hi' </i>to them but they 
	did not smile back. They seemed to be more worried if anyone knew if I was 
	headed there. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	After I assured them nobody knew where I was, Thomas opened 
	the door to his room and let me in first.
	His room was dark and smelled of that wonderful cologne he wore. I went in 
	and sat on his bed while Jerry was making himself comfortable at the desk. 
	He had all sorts of snack food with him and three cans of soda. I laughed to 
	myself as I watched him arrange the items on the desk. 
	After Thomas turned on the lights, he went back to the door, closed it and 
	locked it. I was a little jealous that he had a lock on his door and I 
	didn't. But, he was also located in a different section of the facility than 
	me. I figured that might have had something to do with it. 
	While sitting on the bed, I thought for a moment about the night before when 
	I lay kissing Thomas in that very spot. I was intrigued and ashamed at the 
	same time about the way I was feeling and I felt as though I was blushing.&nbsp; 
	I looked at him and noticed the glance he gave me. I felt that he must have 
	been thinking about last night as well, because he couldn't seem to look me 
	in the eyes.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	<i>&quot;OK guys...&quot;</i> I finally said. <i>&quot;What's going on?&quot;</i><br>
	Thomas looked at Jerry as though it was his cue to start the explaining. 
	Jerry nodded his head as though he understood and shared the following 
	information with me.
	Apparently, on Jerry's lunch break earlier today, he and Thomas decided to 
	head over to the 'Left Wing.' At first, he never really said why they were 
	headed there, but I guess Jerry got caught without a pass. He said he was 
	questioned by the two security nurses about who he was and why he was there. 
	He just kept trying to explain to them that he lost his pass and he was only 
	trying to take a shortcut to the filing room. (That's where they keep the 
	front desk sign-in logs filed) Eventually they escorted him out. 
	He went on saying that while he was being questioned by the security nurses, 
	Thomas was able to sneak by unnoticed. He told me that he continued to make 
	somewhat of a scene so that Thomas could get the information they were 
	looking for. Once Thomas was out of there, Jerry said he just walked away.
	<i>&quot;I thought we got away with it, but I guess they have security camera's in 
	the hall.&quot; </i>Jerry said. <i>&quot;They saw the whole thing and Dr. Hamilton confronted 
	me and Thomas. He confiscated the papers that Thomas got and said we would 
	be dealt with tomorrow.&quot;<br>
	&quot;Yeah, dealt with...what's that supposed to mean?&quot;</i> Thomas interrupted in an 
	annoyed tone. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	I stared at them for a moment then said <i>&quot;They have camera's?&quot;
	&quot;Yea...I didn't know about them.&quot;</i> Jerry said as he opened a can of Cherry 
	Coke and took a long drink.
	The only thing running through my mind was...Oh Shit!, Oh Shit!, Oh Shit!&nbsp; I 
	was there only a short time before Jerry. Did Dr. Hamilton see me visit 
	Carmen and her baby? But more importantly, did he see me make the copies of 
	thoes baby files? And why didn't he say anything to me when I went to his 
	office?<br>
	I felt it was time to share the information I found with Jerry and Thomas. I 
	sat and explained what I read when I went looking for Carmen. <i>&quot;So then...you know?&quot; Thomas said.
	&quot;All I know is that there are three babies with MESI's. One of those babies 
	belongs to my best friend. They have been grouped into something called 
	'Generation 3.' And now they are going to be hidden in some secret part of 
	the facility where 'God only knows' what will happen to them. So I think 
	it's you guys, who need to tell me what's going on?&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;I don't really know what's going on.&quot;</i> Jerry said. 
	<i>&quot;All I know is one of those babies belongs to your friend Carmen....and
	</i>(He paused for a minute then said...) <i>One of those babies is my 
	nephew.&quot; </i>Jerry explained that his sister, Jenna, came here for a tour a few months 
	back and never returned home. He said he came looking for her and found out 
	what was going on....the baby...the mini MESI. They were planning to leave 
	and Dr. Tachikawa found out. He drugged her one night and did an extraction 
	on the baby, which caused her to have an early delivery. The baby was 
	premature, but survived. He was the first born with the MESI, the first born 
	of this new generation. <i>&quot;The girl you saw in the hall was, Simone. She was the second to have her 
	baby.&quot; </i>Jerry explained. <i>&quot;She was my sisters roommate.&quot;</i></span></p>

	<i>&quot;And now Carmen. &quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;I only wonder if Max makes 'Generation 3' 
	complete. Or is three just a temporary number?&quot; </i>I was nervous and sick to my stomach at the same time. What was the plan for 
	those babies?</span></p>
