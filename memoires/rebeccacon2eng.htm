    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I must have read that 
    brochure 20 to 50 times, over and over on the short flight from New York to 
    Vermont. (Well, it was short compared to the flight from Germany to New York!)
    <i>&quot;Makes Your Dreams Come True?&quot; </i>This was something I thought was 
    unfair to promise people, so I definitely wanted to learn more about it. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I landed for the 
    final time, I was more than happy to see the love of my life Bruce, and my 
    friend Josh who was taking care of him during my trip. Bruce is my German 
    Shepherd. I like to confuse people and refer to him as the love of my life. 
    Josh thinks it's funny. But, If I have a crush on anyone, it'd have to be 
    Josh. I think he knows it but, loves the idea that I am too embarrassed to 
    admit it. I met Josh about a week after Carrie and Bernie moved to Germany. 
    We have been friends ever since. He is the one that found me my place. I 
    guess his uncle needed to find a bigger house for him and his family. Josh 
    said this one would be perfect for me and Bruce, he was right.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As soon as I saw the 
    two of them outside the airport, I quickly shoved the brochure in my carry 
    on bag. I could never explain this to Josh. Not until I knew more anyway. 
    And I wanted to learn more as soon as possible. But Josh is the type of guy 
    who likes to grab a Pizza and some beer and sit and chat all night. Normally 
    I'd jump on the moment to spend time with Josh alone but this Braintec thing 
    was killing me with curiosity. My plan was to explain how tired I was and 
    hit the Internet as soon as I got home.</span></p>
