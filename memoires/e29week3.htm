    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It had all gotten too 
    much for me. We had left the uploader in the dark apartment and we were 
    without upload almost twenty hours. The withdrawal symptoms were a disaster. 
    Everything felt empty and cold. And my own feeling, my identity, seemed to 
    be out of reach. I desperately even tried biting an M-Store into pieces with 
    my teeth. As if that would be of any help.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">At least Adrian was in 
    the same bad condition. I’ve never ever seen him so miserable. He was 
    walking up and down and once in a while he was grumbling something. <i>
    “Maybe the idea of bungee</i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">-jumping 
    wasn’t such a bad idea after all,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    I tried to cheer him up. He looked up for an instant. <i>“In any case 
    something should happen,” </i>I continued. <i>“We cannot stay in this room 
    forever.”</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Finally Adrian was 
    able to discuss the matter. He had the same headache and was having problems 
    on concentration too. It wasn’t easy. After talking nonsense he suggested to 
    visit Kodjiro. He owed him a lot of money and seemed to find it difficult 
    spending money from my credit-card. While I had gotten the plastic thing 
    from Mr. Paul and wasn’t paying myself. Out of all people, from the FBI. 
    They discouraged me not to stay close to Dr. Tachikawa. So now what? I 
    couldn’t help thinking about the simple idea that the road to Kodjiro was 
    the road to a new upload. And maybe I missed Kodjiro. Adrian is really very 
    kind; he is like a brother to me, I never had. But I’ve never felt such 
    feelings I have for Kodjiro for him. Again I was asking myself whether 
    Kodjiro could be trusted, although due to my temptation for uploads I 
    finally agreed. Together with Adrian it should be safe.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Kodjiro was totally 
    happy to see us. Shortly afterwards he asked me strictly where I had been 
    during all that time. <i>“To pick up </i></span><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    I lied simplistically. <i>“He can sleep here too, can he?”</i> He agreed a 
    bit grouchy. At least my sleeping-mattress which was left in my rucksack for 
    weeks could be of use now. </span></b></p>
