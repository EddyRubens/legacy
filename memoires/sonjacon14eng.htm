    <span style="font-family: Arial">We took Paul’s car and drove to the 
    location he had chosen – a quiet suburb. In a locker in the entrance hall of 
    the building Paul, who was now somewhat tense, found the parachute and a 
    case with the instruments he needed. He took Rosanne and Adrian to the top, 
    while I waited down there. It took a long time before he came back down 
    again. <i>&quot;They’re very afraid but that’s a good thing, it will make the 
    evidence convincing.,&quot;</i> he said, as he, with the ease that you’d expect 
    from a doctor, filled a syringe with a murky looking fluid from a small 
    bottle. For just a moment our eyes met. He smiled. <i>&quot;When all this is 
    over, I’ll invite you to my </i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">
    Arizona ranch.&quot; </span></i><span style="font-family: Arial">My heart speed 
    increased, and I do believe I was blushing. <i>&quot;But let’s round off this job 
    first..&quot;</i> he said, determined. Very different from Hugo, I thought to 
    myself.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It was a strange sight; 
    two people hanging by a white parachute, smiling, hand in hand, slowly 
    floating downwards from a steel blue sky, almost without a sound, only the 
    rubbing of silk and the resistance of the wind, and some gulls flying 
    somewhere near. Paul injected them the moment they came down and checked the 
    extractors. Before they fell into a deep sleep, he helped them get into the 
    car, while I collected the parachutes and squeezed them in the trunk. In no 
    time we were on our way, shooting past the virgin lawns of the suburb. No 
    one spoke. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was in the front, 
    next to Paul, feeling amazingly relaxed. Paul started talking softly to me. 
    He gave me instructions on how to take the M-Stores to Kodjiro and the 
    Canadian to prove that I had killed Rosanne as well as Adrian. He was 
    clearly worried, but I put him at ease. What could go wrong now? Adrian and 
    Rosanne were in a deep sleep on the backseat. We turned to the motorway as 
    twilight set in. I felt wonderful. I looked at Paul. He was an attractive 
    man, with beautiful, pitch-black eyes and flowing grey hair. Suddenly I 
    longed to go horseback riding with him on the Arizona prairies. And then; 
    evenings by the fireplace... My imagination was running wild. Paul seemed to 
    be guessing my thoughts and grabbed my hand without looking at me. Quietly 
    droning, the car took us over the asphalt into the night. </span></p>
