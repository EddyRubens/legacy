    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I’ve been under the 
    covers for about 52 hours. It’s no surprise that, at two in the morning, I’m 
    wide awake. After the business with Hans and Heather I kept on running until 
    I was just about to fall down. Completely exhausted I ended up leaning 
    against a wall in order to remain standing up. Then I saw a big 
    international hotel across the street, and I decided to check in. I stood in 
    the shower for at least an hour before I finally got into the neatly made up 
    bed. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    dreams started almost immediately. Some of them were the most bizarre 
    hallucinations, some were horrible nightmares. I dreamt I kept falling, with 
    great speed, into a bottomless pit. With every fall I realized I was 
    dreaming, but I couldn’t wake up. I think I must have had a fever ‘coss at 
    one point the sheet was clammy of all my sweating. Yuk. I was troubled and 
    just couldn’t stay in bed. When I got up I had to run to the toilet to stop 
    myself from throwing up on the floor. I’ve never been so sick. Still I knew 
    it was a good thing. I had made an important decision and it was as if my 
    body was protesting against it. But I made my decision to never take an 
    upload again. Far too dangerous. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Am I a hero? I don’t 
    feel like one. Maybe Adrian and I really did save Hans and Heather’s lives. 
    But for how long? It’s just possible they were wasted anyway. And what about 
    Adrian, was he able to escape? At least six Japanese guys were chasing him. 
    It’s possible he didn’t make it. I wonder where he is. Is he alive? I have 
    no control over any of this. Maybe I never did, but it seems to be more 
    difficult now, having an influence over what’s going on. Our lives are at 
    stake now. And I don’t know what to do about it. Outside there’s a crossing. 
    The little noises that is so familiar; the shriek bleeps when the stoplight 
    comes on. The Nintendo-like sound when it turns green. A mix of four or five 
    irritating melodies. It’s driving me crazy. Does this have to go on all 
    night? </span>
