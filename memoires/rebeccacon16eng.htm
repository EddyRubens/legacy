    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I have just returned 
    to my room. I can't explain how I am feeling right now. I feel alone, but in 
    a strange way. It's kind of like the feeling you would get when you know 
    someone is coming over. But, I am not expecting anyone. I have a small scar 
    on the left side of my head, right behind my ear. If I rub my finger over it 
    I can feel the MESI and where the upload (or M-Store, as some people have 
    called them) device will be used. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It has been five days 
    since I had my MESI inserted. I was released from the 'Left Wing' this 
    afternoon. I have to admit that the recovery process was much faster than I 
    expected, even though the first two days, I felt like my head was going to 
    explode! It hurt to blink. Dr. Hamilton said my body absorbed the pain 
    medication much faster than most of the subjects. That is why I was feeling 
    so horriable. I suppose increasing the dose of those little red pills is 
    what helped me recover without pain the remainder of the time. I was asked 
    to take them quite often, I think it was three or four times a day.&nbsp; When I 
    was released I was given a bottle of white pills. They told me to take one 
    anythime I started to feel any discomfort within the first week. After that, 
    I am not suppose to need them anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Sheila came in once to 
    check on my well being. I asked her how Carmen was doing and she just told 
    me to concentrate on getting better. <i>&quot;What kind of answer is that?&quot; </i>I 
    asked her. She said <i>&quot;Sorry, but I am not at liberty to discuss the 
    results of another test subject with you.&quot;</i> I explained that Carmen and I 
    were bestfriends, and that all I wanted to know was if she was okay. She 
    just told me to get some rest and left. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Earlier today as I was 
    heading back to my room, I ran into Dr. Hamilton. He asked me how I was 
    feeling and suggested I get a few days of rest. I told him I would if he 
    would please let me know how Carmen was doing. I explained how Sheila came 
    to visit and wouln'd even say if she was alright. He suggested we go to his 
    office to talk about Carmen's status. Her Status? And why his office? I felt 
    my stomach turn over. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">My head was throbbing, 
    but all I could think about was Carmen. If anything </span>
