    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I emailed Megan to let 
    her know what was going on. I wanted her to be able to come with us to the 
    restaurant. I left my computer on in hopes that she would respond back 
    sometime tonight.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen and I sat for a 
    while and talked about what we were going to do once we got out of this 
    place. I talked about Josh and I getting a place together and hopefully 
    planning a wedding for us. I told her she HAD to be one of my bridesmaids. 
    She laughed and said <i>&quot;What if my belly is so big that I don't fit into 
    the dresses you pick out?&quot;</i> I told her we would just have to buy a big 
    parachute and cut some holes for her head and arms. Of course that got her 
    laughing! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen said she wanted 
    to move out of New Jersey, hopefully to Vermont, so she could be closer to 
    me. She said she really didn't have any close friends. I was the only one. 
    She talked about fixing up a room for the baby. She said she wanted to 
    decorate it like the book, 'Where the Wild Things Are.' She said it would be 
    perfect since the character in the book was named Max. She said she planned 
    on naming the baby Max if was a boy or Maxine if it was a girl. I told her 
    since she was planning on moving so close, that when she bought her house, I 
    would come over and paint the walls in the baby's room like the book. Art 
    was my major in college and my current career.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Just as we were 
    getting ready to turn off the lights, I received an email from Megan. She 
    said; <i>&quot;Rebecca, I am not sure if she will be able to make it to dinner 
    with Carmen, the agents, and you. The doctors have planned some sort of 
    experimental extraction. I am very frightened. I want to tell them to please 
    let me go home, but Dr. Tachikawa has gotten very physical with me. When I 
    returned from our meeting in the Gardens, he grabbed me by my upper arms and 
    shook me while yelling at me. He was mad because I refused to tell him where 
    I was. Then he demanded my father's address in Russia. I would not give it 
    to him in fear he will search for him and do him harm. When he realized I 
    would not give in, he pushed me to the floor. I have horrible bruises on my 
    arms and think I bruised my tailbone when I hit the floor. I have been 
    locked inside my room since then. I will try to email you in the morning. If 
    you do not hear from me, please search to see that I am okay.&nbsp; Megan&quot; </i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She gave directions to 
    where her room was located in the facility. It was way in the back of the 
    East Wing, where security nurses were stationed. No one was really sure why 
    that area was monitored. Now we knew. They were keeping test subjects 
    isolated there. &nbsp;I felt sad and scared for her as I lay down to sleep. But, 
    I knew we would be getting some help soon.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
