    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">A memory originally 
    one of Rosanne’s, was the worst experience I ever had. I was totally not 
    myself. That’s usually the case with an upload, but this time it was so much 
    worse and in a scary way. My heart was pumping too fast and I believe I have 
    never had so much adrenaline. I saw something, an ufo. Normally I would run 
    away under those circumstances or maybe hide myself and carefully look. But 
    now I ran towards it. I was called back by a weird punk rocker who was my 
    boyfriend but I ran further. I had no control over my legs. They didn’t 
    belong to me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Fortunately it wasn’t 
    a real ufo. It was made of plastic. But my heart was still pumping too fast 
    and the atmosphere pushed hard on me. That was the most frightening of all. 
    The clouds, the air, my breath, it all wanted to push me dead. That was so 
    scary. And I had so much energy. My eyes felt stretched and my jaw, my tooth, 
    they hurt. And I had a strange taste. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Fortunately such an 
    upload takes only some seconds, because it was really frightening me. I 
    wanted to forget this memory as soon as possible. But I can still taste it.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I used to watch horror 
    movies with my brother. The ones I was yet too young for. Those movies were 
    sometimes too scary but I continued watching. I used to stay afraid after 
    those movies. That’s how it is right now. It is still scary and I still feel 
    the threat. That you know something is going to be totally wrong but you can’t 
    have any influence on it. I try to realize this is all not for real. Aren’t 
    we supposed to experience only good things around here? </span></p>
