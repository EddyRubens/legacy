    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen and I just 
    returned from the Gardens. I went directly to Dr. Hamilton's office because 
    it was so close to 6:00. Sheila was waiting there for me. She said Dr. 
    Hamilton was going to have to cancel again because one of the test subjects 
    needed to be evaluated. I pretended to act disappointed. There was no way I 
    could focus on an upload after what Carmen told me. I think it would alter 
    my thought process. Also, I am now a little worried that they will find out 
    that I know about Carmen since I am scheduled to get an extraction. What 
    will happen to me if Braintec finds out I know? What would happen to Carmen?

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As I was walking back 
    to my room from Dr. Hamilton's office, I ran into a girl I hadn't seen since 
    I went on the tour of the facility, when I first arrived. Her name was Megan. 
    She had emerald green eyes and beautiful red hair. She was really sweet too. 
    In fact, when we went on the tour together we were talking about how creepy 
    Steward was. <i>&quot;Wow, Hi how are you!&quot; </i>she said. <i>&quot;Oh, I'm good, how 
    about you?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; </i>she continued, <i>&quot; I got the MSI implant. I was 
    really excited to get the uploads at first, then they made me feel strange 
    after a while. After the third one I asked to take a break because they were 
    making me delusional!&nbsp; Dr. Hamilton was really nice about it and said he 
    would give me some time to rest.&quot; &quot;Delusional...really?&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;Yea, 
    but don't tell anyone I told you. Dr. Hamilton told me not to make any 
    friends here because he was just using them for his benefit. Then he 
    mentioned how no one would be very nice to me anyway. He also said....um,...oops!...I 
    think I've said too much! &quot; &quot;No Megan you can trust me! Honest. We spent 
    that whole first day we were here together. You know I am a nice person.&quot;</i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She looked scared and 
    confused. She knew she said too much. The look on my face probably gave it 
    away! I wonder what Dr. Hamilton has been feeding her mind with. I suggested 
    we go outside if she felt uncomfortable. She said she was afraid to be seen 
    with me, so I gave her my email address. I told if she wrote me, nobody 
    would know. She said she would but I think Dr. Hamilton's brainwashing is 
    set to deep in her. And to think, I thought he was such a nice guy! I was 
    even going to try to </span>
