    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I have been home for 
    two days because of Christmas. That’s the advantage of living close to 
    braintec. My father picked me up with his car and Eric was waiting for me at 
    home. Eric is my friend for three months already. My mother made turkey, 
    traditional and very tasteful. It was nice that Eric was there as well. My 
    brothers came as well but my sister didn’t. Last summer she moved to Florida 
    and that’s too far to travel back and forth for only two days. I could see 
    on my mummies face that she didn’t like that, that Lynn wasn’t among us.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Daddy was a bit 
    worried and he wanted to know everything about braintec, how it works 
    precisely, those re-memories. I found it difficult to explain and i think he 
    still doesn’t understand. But i don’t understand either, technologically. 
    But if it works, it works. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After Christmas dinner 
    Eric had to go home because daddy doesn’t want him to stay overnight. But 
    the next morning he came back for me. We have driven to Maine and took the 
    water bus. That was very romantic. During the evening we had dinner again, 
    but then at Eric’s home. </span></p>
