    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed many people of 
    the press arrived. The local radio recorded some interviews and I saw at 
    least six or seven people writing down in their note-books. Dr. Tachikawa 
    gave a speech. First he explained thoroughly about the old devices and 
    processes. Then he showed us the new M-Stores. From the outlook they all 
    resembled the older ones. The new ones were decorated with a relief on the 
    surface. Some stripes and dots. From the inner self only the new M-Stores 
    are compatible with the new type server. I was flabbergasted when Dr. 
    Tachikawa told me that the new server contains all necessary parts for an 
    upload. I immediately understood the idea. No need to be dependant on the 
    clumsy big devices! If these M-Stores with the new server are all you need 
    for an upload, it means that you can recall memories at any desirable 
    location and any suitable time! These devices easily fit into a cigar-box!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>While I realized 
    that Dr.Tachikawa had become successful with this development, I felt proud 
    as a peacock. This man is capable in performing miracles! The press was at 
    least half as impressed by his story as I was. Perhaps they also discovered 
    the new possibilities. If this product will be for sale in the retail market, 
    everybody who can afford it can experience anything he likes at home! Unless 
    they have this implant of course, but nowadays it is just a matter of a 
    poly-clinical surgery. This, undoubtedly, will cause an enormous revolution 
    in the entertainment-branch-industry. <i>“Professor Tachikawa!”</i> a 
    journalist caught his attention. <i>“Did you try out this renewed technique 
    already successfully?”</i> Dr. Tachikawa winked at Adelle to come forward.
    <i>“This woman here has experienced her first own memory according to a 
    M-Store type B in the combined server this morning!” &nbsp;</i>Everybody started 
    applauding spontaneously. <i>“My experience was absolutely fantastic!”</i> 
    Adelle’s enthusiasm attracted others. Everybody seemed to be satisfied.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Some technical 
    problems and questions were posed, some photos were made and the devices 
    were examined closely. In the meantime people were enjoying the buffet. 
    Everybody was in a very good mood. Same with Dr. Tachikawa for he had 
    reached his goal, the press for dealing with a good story and Adelle still 
    fully enjoying her upload. The only person not looking so happy was Dr. 
    Hamilton. He looked a bit worried. Maybe he disliked the feeling that this 
    time he was not in the centre getting fully attention. Or perhaps something 
    else was going on.</span></p>
