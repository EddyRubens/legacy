	I followed Dr. Hamilton down the hall which lead to Adrian's office. I was 
	able to make it all the way without being seen. I found a decent hiding 
	place behind a pillar in the hall and anticipated the show.</span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	I watched Dr. Hamilton listen to whatever conversation was happening behind 
	the door. He stood silently for a moment, shaking his head in disapproval. 
	Then he stood up straight and tall, and flung the door open.<br>
	There was a gasp of suprise inside, and the two (Rosanne and Adrian) were 
	completely quiet.
	I whispered <i>&quot;Suprise!&quot;</i> to myself and let out a bitter little snicker.
	Dr. Hamilton stomped in demanding to know if Adrian was giving Rosanne 
	uploads. I had a pretty good view of Adrian, but Rosanne was a little too 
	far to the right for me to see her expressions. Dr. Hamilton grabbed some 
	things off the table then looked to Adrian for an answer. I could see him 
	shake his head 'yes' then look to the ground like a child in trouble. 
	Rosanne jumped in wailing about how it was all her fault and how she 
	basically bothered Adrian so much, that he didn't have a choice.
	Dr. Hamilton was so angry that he hollered at Rosanne saying, <i>&quot;Just stop! 
	Can't you just be quiet!&quot;</i> He yelled that he was fed up with her and that he 
	was going to arrange for her implant to be removed first thing in the 
	morning. After that, he slammed the door shut and stormed back down the hall 
	with the confiscated equipment in his hands.<br>
	I pressed myself against the wall as Dr. Hamilton stormed by. He was too 
	enraged to notice me and headed back to his office. 
	I wanted to share with Carmen all the excitement that just happened, and was 
	quickly brought down from my high when I realized I was, again, going back 
	to an empty room.</span></p>

	When I returned to the hall where my room was, I noticed that my door was 
	open. I was positive that I closed it when I left. I peeked my head around 
	the door frame to see my room in a complete array. Why was someone going 
	through my room? Then it hit me....the 'Left Wing' pass and the photo 
	copies. Someone must have been looking for them. I saw my suitcase opened 
	with all the contents scattered across the room. The Band-Aid box was lying 
	in the corner, still closed. I was just about ready to head in when I heard 
	a noise coming from the bathroom. Whoever was searching through my room 
	obviously hadn't finished. 
	I had to make a choice. Was I going to run in and retrieve the Band-Aid box, 
	or leave it and hope the whoever was in the bathroom didn't do a more 
	extensive search when I left.
	I stood there for a minute playing the flower petal game in my head...'I 
	should get, I should go, I should get it, I should go.' The last imaginary 
	petal left me with the choice... I should get it. Damn! I never got what I 
	hoped for in that game.</span></p>
	<p>
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">
	I slouched down and crawled in as quietly as I could. I could hear things 
	being tossed aside and a voice cursing. I was afraid to look at the bathroom 
	door and moved as quickly as I could. I grabbed the Band-Aid box and shoved 
	it in the pocket of my pull over hooded, Vermont Cynic, sweatshirt. 
	As I was crawling back to the door, I accidentally bumped into the desk 
	chair and knocked over some magazines that were on the seat of it. I knew I 
	had to get out of there fast, so I stood up to run. Just as I got to my feet 
	I heard a voice yell <i>&quot;Hey...Get over here!&quot;</i> I was too afraid to look and 
	started to run. That's when I felt a sharp blow to the back of my head. I 
	fell back down to my hands and knees and couldn't focus. I wanted to just 
	lay down and cry but I knew I had to get out of there. <i>&quot;I know you have them Bitch...Where are they?&quot; 
	</i>was the last thing I heard 
	before I grabbed my handled, metal makeup case (which was in my suitcase) 
	and swung it at him. I got lucky and clocked him square in the forehead. He 
	fell backwards onto the ground and that's when I got a good look at him.
	It was Agent Andrews.</span></p>
