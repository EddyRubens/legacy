    <span style="font-family: Arial">We’ve got tea and an upload from dr. 
    Tachikawa. Actually I didn’t want an upload and I tried to keep out of it as 
    far as I could. Instead of sitting down and relaxing, I stood straight up 
    and concentrated at two coins in my pocket. I tried to feel through my pants 
    to count how much money it was. That kept my in reality. The upload was gone 
    before I could get into trance. Then Kodjiro’s telephone was ringing, he 
    looked at it and left with these words: <i>“I have to leave now. I will be 
    back tonight. Pretend to be at home.”</i></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Something in his 
    behaviour made me thinking. His laptop was on his desk. I walked towards it 
    and put in on. Password required! I tried several things, but couldn’t come 
    further than “access denied”. <i>“You aren’t to be stopped.”</i> Rosanne 
    said while she stood next to me still a bit dizzy. I typed “Otemba” and the 
    log-in screen disappeared. I had access. Totally confused I scrolled through 
    the screens full of information about every concerning Braintec, monkeys and 
    the employees of Braintec. Test results, video images, all about chimpanzees. 
    The most resent files where about Hans and Heather. The future wasn’t bright 
    for them. They were booked as suspects. Suddenly a loud and clear “PING” 
    from Outlook. A reminder on screen. Kodjrio had an appointment at the 
    Asakusa Temple.</span></p>
