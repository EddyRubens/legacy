    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">Those new M-Stores are terrific! They 
    feel so much more authentic and the intensity is absolute. I had more the 
    feeling of becoming someone else as ever before. This morning I became Lucas 
    when he was approximately fourteen years old. I remember how it was to 
    discover the secrets of life and being a stranger in your parent's house. It 
    was nice. I think Lucas had a better adolescence because his father wasn't 
    an alcoholic. Mine was. He started to drink as soon as he woke up and ruined 
    the whole day for all of us. My sister ran away with a thirty year old 
    boyfriend when she was still at high school. She couldn't take it any longer. 
    I had to stay to help my mum. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">Living through Lucas' experiences at 
    that age, I felt released. My bad memories about my own youth seem to be 
    vanished, washed away. It really gives me a clean feeling and I'm suddenly 
    aware of the heaviness of my own memories I used to carry with me. I feel 
    lighter, almost enlightened. Great!</span></p>
