    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">I woke up to 
    a big surprise this morning. Carmen was back. She said the doctors saw she 
    was only getting better and bored as the days passed so they decided to 
    release her. Yea! I felt so happy! Kinda like the feeling you get when you 
    lose something important to you, then find it again! &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">I told her 
    everything that was going on. She was laughing hysterically about the whole 
    Sheila thing. <i>&quot;That's my girl!&quot;</i> she said still laughing! After that 
    she asked how thing were with me and Josh. That's when I decided to tell her 
    about the letter I received from him the day before surgery.&nbsp; She said that 
    maybe It was time I let him know how I really felt. So with that suggestion, 
    I decided that I would write Josh an honest email. It read:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">
    Dear Josh,</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">
    I have decided to write you this letter hoping that you will understand how 
    I feel about you and why I need to continue my stay at Braintec. I think you 
    know how I feel about you. I think you have known for a long time. If saying 
    it will make you believe it, than that's what I will do. I like you Josh, 
    more than just friends. When people ask how I feel about you, I tell them I 
    love you. Yes,...I love you!&nbsp; Now you know it's true. If you do not feel the 
    same, I will understand and only hope it will not ruin the friendship we 
    have.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">
    As, for Darcy, I feel the letter you wrote me concerning her was entirely 
    inappropriate. You know I don't care for her, and your last letter hurt my 
    feelings. If you choose to spend your time with her while I am away, that is 
    up to you. I would just prefer you don't write to me about it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">
    As for my stay here...I admit at first it was just one of those things where 
    I wanted to know what it was all about. But now that I am here, I believe 
    there is so much more to it. Dr. Hamilton has made his career here believing 
    that this is something that could inevitably cure Alzheimers and Dementia. 
    He even believes that it may cure my phobias! Wouldn't that be great! Well, 
    Josh, I must get going. I hope all is well. Give Bruce my love. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">
    Always,<br>
    Rebecca</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Ten minutes 
    later, I received a reply to my letter. It was short and to the point. It 
    read:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">
    Rebecca,</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">
    I love you, too!&nbsp; I will wait for you no matter how long it takes.&nbsp; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">
    Josh</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; font-weight: 700">
    P.S. Darcy is gone. Bruce bit her.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">I was in 
    shock after I read his letter! He feels the same! Oh, I was so happy! Still 
    am! Of course I had to run and tell Carmen. She was happy for me, too. 
    Things seem to be changing for the better around here! &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">I need to 
    make this short, Dr. Hamilton has promised me my first upload today. His 
    morning was busy, so he scheduled me for a 5:00 appointment. I am sure 
    Sheila will be there. I hope she doesn't ruin things for me! I will write 
    when I return.</span></p>
