    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">That was an impressive 
    memory! I can understand way this is Rosanne’s favorite. For her, this was 
    all about the discovering of a UFO but for me it was something else. But 
    definitely as good. I was the alien. The laws of gravitation were different 
    than usual. My legs were swinging enormously while walking. And I seemed to 
    see the world completely different, as if I saw it for the first time. 
    Everything was so strange and impressive. An apple, the clouds, an 
    unfamiliar piece of equipment. I felt breezily and excited.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Once, when I was in 
    Amsterdam with a couple of friends, I felt the same. We had smoked a joint 
    in a coffee shop and walked in the red-light district. On air I walked and 
    it weren’t only the women who looked attractive. I could even fall in love 
    with the streetlight! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I told this to 
    Rosanne, she felt caught. I wonder if she was under the influence of 
    something. That’s why I asked her if she ever smoked a joint. Without 
    batting an eyelid she answered that in Holland everyone above sixteen has 
    smokes one. Shall it have been weed or something else? A boozer can see them 
    fly as well of course, but I think that’s different. </span>
