    bored stiff for the last three days. I still get wheeled around in the 
    garden after tests, but not as much. I get to walk to the toilet, but that’s 
    all the movement they will allow me. Hanging outside the bed is about the 
    only exercise my legs will get today. Thankfully that will change tomorrow. 
    Then I will begin the physical recuperation process by going onto the 
    gangway. The mental tests will continue also. Math, stock of words training, 
    association tests, you name it. If I hadn’t gotten along with the test 
    psychologist so well, I would probably have refused to cooperate. Stupid</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">

    from staring at the ceiling is Robbert, a fellow test subject. Too bad he prefers reading 
    all day; otherwise I might have found a more regular chess opponent. Who 
    knows, maybe I can share his passion for books sometime, as Robbert’s got a 
    MESI implant, like me. He is the third man who has one implanted and I am 
    the first women. That makes us an important couple. His implant was done 
    precisely a week before mine. Seeing him do so well gives me rene</span><span style="font-family:
