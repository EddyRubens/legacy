    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I’m much better now, 
    thankfully. It’s quite alright really, the way things are now. I’m a little 
    hazy, I have no pain and all the time in the world. I’m reading a bit, 
    playing games and of course laying those jig-saws. The black hole, in which 
    I threatened to disappear, is all gone. I’m cheerful, friendly and 
    merry. My positive attitude is in sync with my physical recovery. The better 
    I get, the more cheerful I become. And as my recovery progresses, I am given 
    more freedom, which helps to make me feel better. The day before yesterday I 
    was allowed to go back to my ‘own’ room so I’m finally rid of that dreadful 
    see through mirror. Just as during the test week I am now to report at set 
    times to the appropriate team members for tests, physiotherapy and such. The 
    rest of the time I’m ‘off’. It’s almost like being back at school, going 
    from classroom to classroom with the occasional free period. I’m pretty 
    pleased. I’ve gone off most of my medication. I will keep using 
    anti-epileptics, out of precaution. According to Dr. Hamilton it’s very 
    unlikely that the implant will ever cause another attack though. Every new 
    day symbolizes another jump forward. If things continue in this tempo, I’ll 
    be back to normal soon. The doubts I was having for a while are all  
    gone. I’m still me. The implant has not affected my personality and also 
    didn’t cause any brain injuries. I have to say I was afraid of that when the 
    epileptic attacks started happening. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Still, it’s a strange idea, having an implant inside my head. Dr. Hamilton 
    says that the surrounding cells are connecting well to the implant, which 
    they have now accepted as a part of the neurosystem. A nice idea, being able 
    to augment the body like that. I don’t feel it at all anymore. It’s there of 
    course. But like my kidneys or pancreas; I don’t feel it. I’m glad about 
    that, ‘coss I’d hate to think it could start itching or something like that.
