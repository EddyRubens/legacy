	<span style="font-family:Arial">While waiting, I decided to check my emails. 
	There was one from Mr. Isakova, one from Josh and one from Josh's mother. I 
	read Mr. Isakova's first.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">&quot;Miss Rebecca Reynolds,<br>
	I want to thank you for all that you have done to help my daughter. I met up 
	with your friend Agent Kaleb Desmond very early this morning, in Japan. He 
	is a very good man. He told me of which flight my Megan was to come in by. 
	When the plane arrived, Tachikawa was unable to reach his car to leave. 
	Agent Kaleb Desmond distracted him and was able to free Megan. They ran to a 
	car where I was waiting.&nbsp; He did his best to follow, but failed. Thanks to 
	you, Megan is no longer a prisoner of that monstrous man. Megan, Agent Kaleb 
	Desmond and I, are on a flight to Sweden as I write you. There was mention 
	of a doctor who will remove the device in her head. Agent Desmond has 
	mentioned that you and your friend will join us soon. I cannot wait to meet 
	you and thank you in person. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">Because you have helped 
	me and my daughter, I have sent two of my most trusted friends to Oregon to 
	help you leave the facility. They are to meet with Agent Kaleb Desmond 
	partner, Agent David D. Davis, when their planes arrive at the airport. I am 
	unsure of their plan of action, once they arrive. All I know it will be 
	sometime tomorrow evening. Good Luck!<br>
	Mr. Dimitri Isakova&quot;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I was done reading his letter I 
	realized I was crying. Megan was safe! She was safe because I helped her. 
	Who's to say what those faux Agents would have done to help. Nothing, 
	because they are on Tachikawa's side.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">All the pieces were slowly falling into 
	place. They initially made appearances to watch over Rosanne but, they found 
	out about Kaleb and his connection to the CIA. Then Megan, and her father's 
	former high rank in the KGB, Carmen and her baby, being one of three with 
	miniature MESI's, (Which I have come to find out is linked to something 
	bigger called 'Generation 3') and I knew about all of it. They were here to 
	silence us. </span></p>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">But, what makes matters 
	worse is they had the nerve to bring Josh and Diego into it. I don't know 
	why that suprises me. Dr. Tachikawa would stop at nothing to get what he 
	wanted.</span><p class="MsoNormal" align="right">
