    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen and I talked 
    for a while about what was happening with Megan. She said, <i>&quot;It's horrible 
    how they are so nice to us in the beginning. They lied right to our faces. 
    Now we are all trapped here like a bunch of animals with these stupid things 
    stuck in out brains!&quot;</i> I couldn't have put it better myself! She agreed 
    to go and talk to Jerry if I would sit down and search the Internet about 
    the CIA. We had to be sure that 'Agent Andrews' was for real before we made 
    any attempts to speak with him. I sat on my bed with my laptop and began to 
    search. Carmen said she would be back as soon as she could. I went to a few 
    site with no luck. There was nothing that would reveal any information about 
    CIA agents. After about an hour of searching I finally came across a site 
    that gave out more information that any of the others. All I had to do was 
    type in the badge number of Agent Andrews. I was granted access to an online 
    CIA operator. This was a link where the operator would give back immediate 
    answers to questions. Sort of like an online chat.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As I was typing in our 
    situation and the name and badge number of the agent, Carmen returned. I 
    asked her to hold on for on second. After I pressed enter, a message came up 
    on the screen. It read; <i>&quot;Your question is being processed by a Central 
    Intelligence Agency Operator. Please wait for your response. Thank you!&quot; </i>
    I turned to Carmen and said, <i>&quot;Okay ... spill it!&quot; </i>She smiled and said,
    <i>&quot;I talked to Jerry and got the room of Kaleb Desmond! He is right around 
    the corner from us. I was asking Jerry about him and he said that Kaleb had 
    a twin brother, Kasey. He mentioned they were both looking into becoming 
    government agents until Kasey was murdered one night. I guess nobody really 
    knows what happened or why it happened.&quot; &quot;Well, why is he here at Braintec?&quot;</i> 
    I asked</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen said she asked 
    Jerry the same thing and he said it was because Kaleb wanted to relive 
    memories of when Kasey was alive. <i>&quot;That's so depressing!&quot; </i>I said. <i>
    &quot;But it explained why the CIA was interested in contacting Kaleb. He was 
    almost one of their own.&quot;</i> But it still didn't explain why they chose to 
    contact me.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">My computer suddenly 
    made a beeping noise and a message came across the screen. It said; <i>&quot;You 
    have a message from the Central Intelligence Agency. </i></span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial"><i>Please click here to open.&quot;</i> 
    So I did.</span></p>
