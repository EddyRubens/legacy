    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">This 
    morning I was shown the vase that the other test person had seen. Nothing 
    like my vase! My vase was even uglier and also bigger. This vase was like a 
    bad copy of the vase I experienced yesterday. This vase, the real vase, 
    disappointed me. Jessica said that was no tragedy. Everybody matches the 
    memories to their own experiences, she told me. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Fortunately the 
    doctors were not disappointed. I’m as big a hero as I was yesterday. Dr. 
    Tachikawa even invited me to diner. I hope my acceptance didn’t sound too 
    eager. I’m just so ready to get out of this place. If I were to go into town 
    alone I’d probably end up at Wendy’s again. Now I’m going to a fancy 
    restaurant, Japanese probably. I’ve never been good with the sticks, I’m 
    sure Dr. Tachikawa will be amused by my clumsiness. He is smaller than me 
    and often chuckles like a child. I can’t figure him out most of the time. Is 
    his invitation to diner a date or does he want to observe his test subject 
    in a natural environment?</span></p>
