    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I felt so completely 
    drained after my upload. Then I remembered that I would most likely be 
    feeling this way the rest of the evening. These uploads seem to last in your 
    brain until you sleep them off.&nbsp; I think that is why Dr. Tachikawa scheduled 
    our uploads for today. Did he have an idea of what was going on? Carmen's 
    upload was next. This was only her second one. I could tell she was very 
    nervous, since she knew mine didn't go well. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton offered 
    me his chair to sit in, as Carmen climbed into the uploading chair. Sheila 
    gave me sort of a dirty look. It seemed she was trying to say, <i>'That's my 
    man!' </i>without actually saying it! I just ignored her. I was too busy 
    worrying if Dr. Tachikawa switched Carmen's upload as well. As the lights 
    were going to dim, it fazed me that I have never seen an upload being 
    performed. This was a kind of behind the scenes look. It was all very 
    interesting.&nbsp; I was so busy watching everyone else, that I didn't realize 
    Carmen was crying. In fact, it wasn't until the lights went on that I was 
    sure that she was crying. I got up quickly and went to her. <i>&quot;What was it?&quot;</i> 
    I asked. She looked over at Dr. Tachikawa and said, <i>&quot;You bastard! How 
    dare you! I can't believe that a person can be such a monster!&quot;</i> She just 
    cried as Dr. Tachikawa stood up and walked to the door. Before he left, he 
    turned and looked at Carmen and I. He smiled and said, <i>&quot;Looks like 
    another successful day in the uploading room!&quot; </i>He started laughing and 
    then left. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I looked at Dr. 
    Hamilton. His face was as red as a beet. I could tell by the look on his 
    face that he was filled with rage and anger. It was at that moment, that I 
    realized that poor Dr. Hamilton was as much a victim here as Carmen, Megan, 
    Kaleb and Kasey, and myself.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Sheila brought Carmen 
    a glass of water. She was clearly more shaken up from the upload she 
    received. Dr. Hamilton told her he would give her a few minutes to relax and 
    calm down, before they journaled it into her file.&nbsp; Carmen said she just 
    wanted to get it over with and go back to our room. Dr. Hamilton picked up 
    his pen and wrote in Carmen's file as she described what had happened in the 
    upload.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;It was night, &quot;
    </i>she started. <i>&quot;I was in bed, dreaming. Everything was okay...until I 
    got the pain. It was a horrible pain in my abdomen. Much worse than any 
    cramps I've ever had. I felt hot and sweaty. Someone was laying next to me 
    but I didn't want to wake him, so I went into the bathroom. That's when I 
    saw it. The lower half of my nightgown was covered in blood. I was so scared. 
    So much in pain. </i>(she stated to cry again)<i> I was having another 
    miscarriage...it was the third one!&quot;</i> She was having a hard time talking, 
    so Dr. Hamilton told us to go get some rest. </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was 4:30pm when we 
    got back to our room. I told Carmen she should lay down for forty-five 
    minutes. We were planning on leaving at 5:15, to have dinner with the agents. 
    She agreed. It is now 4:45pm and Carmen has fallen fast asleep. I am 
    planning to go talk to Kaleb. I wonder if he has found a way to help Megan.</span></p>
