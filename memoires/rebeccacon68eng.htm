    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I was walking 
    down the hall looking for Carmen, I saw Steward and Rosanne talking about 
    missing equipment. Rosanne was writing things down. I'm guessing she was 
    making a list of missing items. I saw Adrian in the communion-room as I 
    passed by. He was speaking with Adelle.&nbsp; I was glad to see that he was 
    preoccupied at the moment. I passed by unnoticed. </span></p>

    <a target="_top" href="e22link2.htm">find out how it was for Rosanne</a></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I found Carmen, 
    she was still talking to Jerry. I didn't want to interrupt. I assumed he 
    would stop talking if I went over there, so I just stood looking out of a 
    window. I was lost in thought before I realized a presence standing next to 
    me. It was Dr. Hamilton. <i>&quot;Hello....&quot; </i>He said. <i>&quot;A M-Store for your 
    thoughts...&quot;</i> I smiled at his stupid joke. Even though I'm still not sure 
    if Dr. Hamilton is helping Dr. Tachikawa, I can't help but like him. He has 
    always been decent to me and I feel I have to respect that. <i>&quot;Hi, Dr. 
    Hamilton.&quot;</i> I smiled and said to him. <i>&quot;May I ask what you were 
    thinking about?&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;Well,&quot;</i> I responded. <i>&quot;I was just 
    thinking about all of the commotion that happened earlier. And...well, there 
    have been rumors going around that Dr. Tachikawa has left...for good. Is 
    that true?&quot; &quot;My Dear,...you have nothing to worry about.&quot;</i> He said to me.
    <i>&quot;I am sure that people have told you that Dr. Tachikawa has put forth a 
    lot of the funding for this facility to operate. But, there are other 
    sources which we can turn to for financial support.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I just kept looking 
    out the window. The last thing I was worried about was the finances of this 
    place. But, since he took it upon himself to talk about it, I could see it 
    was the first thing on Dr. Hamilton's mind. <i>&quot;By the way, I wanted to let 
    you know, that I have scheduled you to receive an upload tomorrow at 
    5:00pm.&quot;</i> He continued. <i>&quot;I know we usually don't do them so close 
    together, but I am always willing to make acceptions for you. You have been 
    through a lot with Tachikawa and I want to make it up to you. I'll see you 
    then.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He turned and walked 
    away. I never had the chance to comment or tell him I wasn't up for it. I 
    will have to figure a way out of it tomorrow. When Dr. Hamilton was out of 
    site, Carmen came over to me. <i>&quot;What are you doing out here?&quot; </i>She said.
    <i>&quot;I was worried about you.&quot;</i> I told her. She smiled and said, <i>&quot;Thanks, 
    but now that Dr. Tachikawa is gone I think we're safe. Anyhow, lets go back 
    to our room, your not going to believe what Jerry told me!&quot;</i></span></p>
