    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">I am back at the left wing department 
    where they can get a better eye on me. Because it went totally wrong. They 
    wanted to give me another upload but I didn’t let them. I got very afraid 
    seeing the devices and slammed around me. It was deep fear I felt. I have 
    never experienced something as fearful as this. I thought they would 
    brainwash me or wanted to kill me. Then I woke up. They had strangled me. 
    The nurse untied me when I kept quiet. Then I wanted to call daddy and I was 
    allowed to. I cried at the phone and said that I wanted to go home. My daddy 
    arrived here within two hours as we don’t live that far from here. But they 
    didn’t let me go. Daddy was angry and I was as well because I want to go 
    home but I am not allowed. Because I still have this stupid thing inside my 
    brains. Daddy understood and he ordered to remove it immediately. But they 
    couldn’t because Tachikawa isn’t here. My daddy became even more angry and 
    they talked it over. I think they will remove it tomorrow. </span></p>
