    Kodjiro was not there! We had made an agreement that he would pick me up 
    from the airport and I was anxious to meet him and could hardly wait to see 
    him again. I had been waiting for him for at least more than twenty minutes 
    at the arrival lounge and a few times I’d thought I saw him standing there. 
    Whenever I walked over to him it seemed to be another Japanese or somebody 
    with the same figure. I gave him another ten minutes. If he would not show 
    up then I would leave for the Research Centre by taxi. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">No need for that. A 
    few minutes later McKenzie, (jack-of-all-trades), suddenly was standing in 
    front of me. <i>“Sorry I’m a bit late,”</i> he apologized. <i>“There was a 
    traffic block”</i>. Later in the car I asked him why Dr. Tachikawa did not 
    collect me. <i>“No time for that”</i>, McKenzie explained. <i>“His mind is 
    set on a new type of M-Stores which he is developing now”</i>. A new kind of 
    M-Stores! The old types were perfect? Why he urgently had to develop a new 
    type while he promised to pick me up from the airport? Of course such 
    thoughts are not promising for the development of human kind, but I was very 
    disappointed. Fortunately Kodjiro did not forget me at all. 'Coss he had 
    asked McKenzie to pick me up. A new type of M-Stores is a competition I 
    probably cannot cope with…..</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Luckily the others had 
    time for me. Adelle hugged me and for a moment I even appreciated her 
    perfume. I was home again and Adelle was part of it all. Adrian too seemed 
    to be pleased I had returned. He was anxious to know how my family was doing 
    and he was glad I brought him Dutch shag. Immediately he prepared one. Also 
    Jessica hugged me. You could see she was relieved when I told her that I 
    hadn’t missed the uploads. The one and only person I missed most did not 
    show up. It seemed not convenient asking anybody whether they knew where 
    Kodjiro was. The fact that he couldn’t save time to pick me up from the 
    airport I could still understand. But to come and pat me over my head does 
    not last that long? </span></p>
