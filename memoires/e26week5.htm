    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">When we were inside, he motioned me to sit down at the table opposite him.&nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“What exactly do 
    you know about Hans and Heather?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    he asked. Oh no, I thought. That’s not how we are playing the game. <i>
    “First you tell me everything you know about Sonja and Jessica,”</i> I gave 
    tit for tat. Kodjiro sighed for a moment and answered he knew just as much 
    as I did about Sonja. That she had left Hugo, which he knew indeed for a 
    couple of years already through his work. And about the fears she’s having 
    whenever she thinks they want to kill her. I can imagine that, since I had 
    this experience just a few moments ago in that alley… </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"> <i>”And for Jessica,”</i> 
    Kodjiro continued. <i>“You will see her tomorrow.”</i> That sounded 
    reasonable and I told him all I knew about the escape of the new test 
    subjects. About this news report on the local radio and TV in Portland and 
    how they were described as professional criminals. I told Kodjiro that I 
    didn’t believe they had bad intentions. Actually I do not know those test 
    subjects, although I have spoken to Hans during a Braintec-presentation in 
    Holland. It appears to me that they are victim of fears and persecution 
    mania as well. <i>“That’s possible, indeed,”</i> Kodjiro answered. <i>
    “Whenever the amygdale is over-stimulated, paranoia seems to be normal.” </i>
    He explained more about the medical details, but I didn’t understand him 
    very well. It made sense. <i>“I wish you all the best,”</i> he continued his 
    argument.&nbsp; <i>“I must say that I’m not interested anymore in all the fuzz in
    </i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">Portland. They make a mess 
    out of it and there’s no progress at all.”</span></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Actually I wanted to 
    ask Kodjiro about his role-playing part in it. But I did not dare to ask. 
    Instead of that I asked him about Steward and his rancid practices. He 
    jumped as if he got stung by a wasp. <i>“And now what?”</i> he yelled. <i>
    “What are you talking about?”</i> Kodjiro scared me. That’s not the man I 
    used to know. I rushed to the door so that I could sneak outside if he would 
    approach me too closely. <i>“You have become a real spitfire yourself!”</i> 
    I shouted in a tempting way. <i>“Did you also install an implant? You have 
    exactly the same temper I had some time ago!</i></span><i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"> 
    And I used to think Japanese control their emotions so well and that they 
    think of such behavior as barbaric!</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>”</i> Kodjiro broke down. He 
    fell apart on the floor like a pudding and started gasping very softly. 
    Slowly I came forward. <i>“Sorry,”</i> he sniffled<i>. “I don’t know what 
    happened to me...”</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">I cannot stand men crying. Of course they have the 
    right to show emotions but a man crying I find disgusting. Especially if it’s 
    Kodjiro. I muttered that everything was fine and grabbed my coat to go out 
    for a walk. After one hour I returned. Kodjiro was playing a video-game. 
    Lots of shooting and violence. We behaved as if nothing happened. Like we 
    were married for years.&nbsp; </span></p>
