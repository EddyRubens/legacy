    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">During 
    the wedding ceremony I shed a little tear. Heather looked beautiful in her 
    white dress. I’m usually not so emotional at such occasions. But so much has 
    happened the last few months. And the people here are all close to my heart. 
    Steve and Robbert came over especially for the occasion. Good to see them as 
    well. Lucas, who’s flying back to Ireland with a lot of valuable information 
    soon, was looking </span><span style="font-family: Arial">good. Davel has 
    become great friends with Sally, who is dying to continue her studies. On 
    the other side of the room Sally and Jessica were deep in conversation. 
    Getting on like a house on fire, those two!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Tomorrow 
    morning Dr. Hamilton will remove my implant. As soon as I’m fully recovered 
    from the operation, I’m out of here. Dr. Hamilton has given me a nice cheque 
    for my contributions to the whole. So I can do what I like, go where I want 
    to. But what do I want? Now that I’m seeing all these happy couples around 
    me, it’s not hard to figure that out. Back to Japan! In my mind someone is 
    still sitting near the entrance of the metro station, waiting for me. With 
    his white socks. I can’t shake that image. Or should I ignore my feelings 
    this once and follow my intellect? In that case I’m going back to Holland.

    </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Totally unexpected, 
    Steward lands on the seat next to me. What’s he doing here? Wasn’t Braintec 
    totally cleared? With a look of conspiracy he whispered: <i>“I’ve got 
    another nice upload for you. One you won’t want to miss!”</i> </span>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">That snake! </span>
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">How dare he assume… <i>“It’s 
    one of Kodjiro’s memories,” </i>Steward continued undisturbed. <i>“A memory 
    he has of you. It’s really a nice one.” </i>I was dazing. I had been 
    determined to never take another upload. Now I felt that longing again. One 
    of Kodjiro’s memories, of me! That would be fantastic! Shall I take one last 
    upload then, before tomorrow, before my implant comes out? </span></p>
