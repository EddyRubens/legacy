	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">While Carmen and I 
    waited for a response, she put a French braid in my hair. We talked about 
    where Dr. Tachikawa could have went. About half an hour passed when I 
    decided to check my emails. There was an answer from both Agent Andrews and 
    Megan's family. I read the letter from Agent Andrews first. It said;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">
    Miss Reynolds, <br>
    First, I would like to apologize for our phone not working. The existing 
    problems are being looked into as I write this letter. I would rather not 
    discuss our business via Internet, so if you would, give us an hour and try 
    the phone number again. If it does not work, we will have to schedule 
    another place as to where we can meet. I hope to speak to you within the 
    hour. <br>
    Agent Andrews</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I told Carmen what he 
    said in the email. She decided that she would go talk to Jerry while we were 
    waiting for the hour to pass. <i>&quot;Any extra information couldn't hurt!&quot; </i>
    She said. I waited until she left, then I read the email from Megan's family. 
    It read as follows;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">To 
    Rebecca Reynolds<br>
    Thank you for writing to my family. We have not heard from Megan for many 
    weeks. We have been very worried. You mentioned trouble for Megan. That she 
    is missing. Thank you for trying to help. Arrangements have been made to 
    find her location. Please keep in contact. Any information will help.<br>
    Mr. Nikolai Isakova</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I responded back;<br>
    <i>To Mr. Isakova,<br>
    I am writing to let you know that the terrible doctor I mentioned in my 
    first letter, has left the company. There is talk that he could have gone to 
    Japan. The name he was using in this facility was Dr. Kodjiro Tachikawa. 
    Apparently it was a false name. His real name is Shinicho Matsushita. This 
    is private information the CIA revealed to me. I don't know if this is of 
    any help to you, but I am willing to let you know everything I know, if it 
    will find Megan. I will write again when I know more. <br>
    Rebecca </i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After I finished the 
    letter I decided to go find Carmen. At the rate people have been 
    disappearing around here, I was worried I might lose her as well. </span>
