    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I returned to the 
    facility from the Japanese Gardens, I was a bit worried that Dr. Hamilton 
    would be waiting for me. I know it was rude to ignore him earlier, but I had 
    other things I felt I needed to deal with first. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I realized he was 
    no where to be seen, I hurried back to my room. I was sure that Sheila might 
    be lingering in the shadows somewhere and I didn't want to get pulled aside. 
    There was no way I felt like discussing how I was feeling. All I wanted to 
    do was get back to my room and make sure that Carmen was okay. I also wanted 
    to tell Carmen about Dr. Tachikawa and how he is trying to get KGB secrets 
    from Megan. I know I can trust Carmen not to say anything. When I opened the 
    door to my room, Carmen looked as though she had seen a ghost. <i>&quot;Are you 
    okay?&quot;</i> I asked. <i>&quot;Oh My God, Rebecca!&quot; </i>she said. <i>&quot;You are never 
    going to believe what happened while you were gone.&quot;</i> I started to feel 
    nauseous when she said that. I assumed that they had done something to her. 
    &quot;What did they do to you? What did they say? Are you okay? What happened?&quot; I 
    rambled on.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen stopped my 
    cycle of questions and said, &quot;<i>I'm fine but let me tell you what happened...After 
    you left there was some strange guy walking around the halls. He was asking 
    the test subjects all sorts of questions about Braintec. I caught Rosanne 
    walking down the hall and asked her who he was. She said she had to go see 
    Dr. Hamilton and couldn't talk but he was just a 'Public Health Inspector.'</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen continued to 
    tell me about how he checked all the permits and was going around with his 
    series of questions. She said she watched him as he did his questioning. <i>
    &quot;He didn't seem too sincere regarding the answers he was given.&quot;</i> Carmen 
    said <i>&quot;It was like he really didn't care what people were saying. He was 
    more concerned if anyone knew three specific test subjects here.&quot;</i> When I 
    asked who the three people were Carmen told me three names, <i>&quot;Kaleb </i>
    </span><i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Desmond, Megan 
    Isakova, and Rebecca Reynolds.&quot;</span></i></p>
