    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">The small map Rosanne gave me turned out to 
    be extremely accurate. Indeed I stood for the door of a bloodbank. Inside, 
    at the desk I gave a false name, excused timidly, for the fact I came here 
    to give blood for money. The lady behind the desk smiled and showed me a 
    door. <i>&quot;You go,&quot;</i> she said and nodded. I went through the door and 
    entered a long corridor with offices at both sides where men and women in 
    white coats were taking blood. Nothing striking. I left the corridor, 
    self-assured, as if I was meant to be there, and took the door to the 
    staircase.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Inside the staircase I had to guess: the 
    attic or the cellar? I chose the last one, usually in movies the cellar is 
    the location for business that cannot bear daylight – and this whole 
    situation still resembled a movie a lot.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Poor Rosanne, how could I 
    make clear that she had to run, from Tokyo, away from Braintec. She is too 
    much under the influence of Tachikawa, who naturally abuses her affection 
    and blind trust, while he is making her dependent on his addictive uploads.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">The heavy metal door towards the cellar was 
    open. Another corridor, with tubes against the wall and now and then 
    illuminated by aggregate lamps. At the concrete floor some pools of water, 
    and wooden boxers against the wall. Nothing special. In the distance I heard 
    the noise of turbines. I walked further. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">A small dark corridor at the left side. I 
    had a tiny little lamp at my bunch of keys, but it was better than nothing, 
    and I clicked it on while I sneaked through the corridor. Suddenly it became 
    terribly silent. Feeling my way I found out that the corridor had a dead 
    end. With the small lamp I saw again a metal door, with a long irony brace. 
    I pushed against it. It moved. A penetrating smell. I was in a blue lighted 
    high room separated in two with plastic rags. In the distance I heard 
    rumbling, a metallic sound. Suddenly, behind the plastic, an icy scream! My 
    heart stopped pumping for a while and I gasped for air. Then I heard a 
    Japanese voice, comforting. I peeped through a chink in the plastic. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">In the blue dusk I descried rows of cages 
    against the wall in the back, in which dark shadows were moving, reaching 
    till the far ceiling. In the middle of the room stood a table, illuminated 
    by a desk spot, where a man in a white coat was reading. I took the first 
    heavy object I could find, a board, and sneaked behind the man. Without 
    thinking I gave him an enormous hit on his head. He looked at me surprised, 
    and in the meantime he collapsed slowly from his chair to the ground, 
    without sound. <i>&quot;Sorry for that,&quot;</i> I whispered. There were more 
    movements in the cages. And a cacophony of screams and yells, groaning and 
    cries burst out. I held my hands at my ears, so hard and penetrating it was, 
    and I stood there until the last echoes were gone. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Apes. Blood-donors? No 
    way! Animal testing? A huge male baboon showed me his enormous teeth and 
    looked threatening to me with his blinking beady eyes. I glanced through the 
    papers the man was reading. Uploads! The animals were making uploads! In the 
    papers was securely written which animal and when. What was this all about?
