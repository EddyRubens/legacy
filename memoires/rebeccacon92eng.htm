    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">On the walk over to the 'Left Wing,' I was 
	feeling so mad and betrayed by the 'Agents.' I started thinking about all 
	the things they said and all the promises they made, and how they didn't 
	follow through with one of them. They were obviously 'dirty' agents working 
	with Dr. Tachikawa. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">What is strange to me is the realization 
	that they must have been working on getting rid of all evidence that could 
	leak Dr. Tachikawa's business for quite some time now. I remember the man on 
	my flight from Germany asking Rosanne all those questions, turned out to be 
	Agent Andrews. Then he came to the facility searching for only three 
	specific people. He must have known that Dr. Tachikawa had Rosanne in his 
	grasps. He was in charge of getting rid of the other three who knew just a 
	little too much! Then, poor Carmen gets dragged into the mix because of the 
	mistake she made letting the doctors implants her baby with the minuscule 
	MESI. I think what angers me the most was thinking how they completely 
	tricked me when Carmen was losing the baby back at the Staybridge. They made 
	me think she was being taken away in that helicopter. They're horrible! I 
	can't believe I allowed myself to think they were actually here to help. How 
	could I be so nieve! I should have known when I offered them information and 
	they were not interested in hearing it, something was wrong.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I reached the entrance to the &quot;Left 
	Wing,' the anger subsided and I felt a little nervous. I don't know what I 
	would do if anything ever happened to Carmen. We were so close now, like 
	sisters. I think the bond between us was tighter than the one Carrie and I 
	formed. Maybe it is because Carmen and I have gone through so much together 
	in such a short time. I pushed through the double doors and walked in. There 
	were quite a few security nurses stationed in various places down the hall. 
	Luckily, I didn't know any of them and they didn't know me. But I did notice 
	how they all checked to see if I had a pass to be in that sector. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I walked down the hall a bit looking into 
	the rooms as I passed them. I didn't see Carmen in any of them. When I 
	reached the main counter I thought there would be a log identifying patients 
	with room numbers, but I couldn't see one right off. Since the counter desk 
	was empty, I walked around behind it and sat in the dark blue rolling chair. 
	There were a few metal file folders lying on the desk. I lifted up the first 
	one and read the name on it, 'Trent Weaver.' The next one I read said, 'Stella 
	Kirkland.' I picked up one more and the name read, 'Max Montero.' None of 
	them were Carmen. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I turned around to the computer which was on 
	the back desk. I decided to type in Carmen's name and do a quick search in 
	the medical program they had installed. (It was very similar to the one we 
	used at the school when it was time to do grading.) When I typed in her name 
	and pushed 'Search,' I had to wait for it to process. The computer was an 
	older model and took longer for information to come through. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">While the computer was searching, a Braintec 
	neurosugeron assistant came to the front desk and asked for the files on 'Generation 
	3.' I looked down at the desk unsure what to hand him. <i>&quot;You must be one 
	of the new people, right?&quot; </i>he said to me. <i>&quot;Well, new to this section.&quot;</i> 
	I said with a smile. I had to make him believe I was new and not snooping. I 
	also didn't want him to notice to computer behind me doing a search. <i>
	&quot;Well, they must have given you some information on 'Generation 3,'...you 
	know...the babies.&quot;</i> He continued. <i>&quot;Oh yes, the babies!&quot; </i>I said. &quot;<i>I 
	must have misunderstood you the first time. </i></span>
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">They never said anyone 
	would be picking up those files today. They must still have them in the file 
	vault.&quot;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family:Arial"><i>&quot;The vault?&quot;</i> he 
	said. <i>&quot;I don't know of any file vault here.&quot; &quot;Yes, there is one.&quot;</i> I 
	said, trying to sound like I knew what I was talking about. <i>&quot;Well, where 
	else do you think they keep the covert and highly concealed cases?&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">He stared at me for a minute. He was 
	obviously in thought. <i>&quot;Well,...&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;I suppose you would 
	know more about those things than I would. I didn't realize I needed to put 
	in a request for the files. Look...I'm running late for a surgery, I'll have 
	to come back and do this later.&quot; &quot;OK,&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;I'll see you later 
	then.&quot;</i> He walked quickly away, turned the corner and was gone. I had to 
	take a deep sigh of relief. That was a close one.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Just then, the computer made a funny little 
	sound and I turned around. On the screen it had Carmen's name and room 
	number. I was so excited and wanted to hurry and go find her, until I 
	noticed something strange typed under her name. It said: 'Generation 3'- 
	Name: Max Montero- Status: infant #3, obtained. I knew I had heard that name 
	before. It took me a moment, then I realized that Max Montero was one of the 
	names in the metal file folders. When I finally put two and two together, I 
	remembered Max was the name Carmen was telling me that she wanted to name 
	her baby. And, Montero is Diego's last name. I swung the chair around to 
	grab the metal file folder with Max's name in it. I took it out and read 
	that he was born premature two nights ago, the night we were at the 
	Staybridge Suites. It was also noted that an extraction was done on the baby 
	and Carmen while she was giving birth. I grabbed the other two baby files 
	and Max's, and made a quick photo copy of them. My heart was pounding in 
	fear that I would be caught, but no one saw. I folded up the copies and put 
	them in my bra. I didn't want to take any chances. I left from behind the 
	counter and noticed it was 1:45pm. I had to hurry and find Carmen to see 
	what was going on and then get back, unnoticed, for my upload.</span></p>
