	<span style="font-family:Arial">We pulled into the parking lot of the 
	Staybridge Suites in no time at all. The place was beautiful. A large brick 
	building surrounded with greenery and lights. It slightly resembled a 
	castle. I thought that was a bit ironic...A princess in distress (me), a 
	prince waiting in a castle (Josh), ready to rescue me from the evil dragon. 
	(Dr. Tachikawa) Sort of like a fairytale.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Anyhow, we got out of the car and walked up 
	the brick paved path. Just before the entrance to the front doors, I 
	couldn't help but notice the covered oning held up with pillars. The lights 
	shining off the pillars and down from the covered top gave it an enchanting 
	effect. When we walked into the lobby, the atmosphere gave off nothing but a 
	welcoming feeling. I felt a bit guilty letting myself feel relaxed and calm, 
	when Megan must be fearing for her life and Kaleb clinging tight to his. 
	There were many amenities here. The Agents were obviously use to traveling 
	in comfort. I wasn't sure how to absorb all that was surrounding me. I 
	myself, was a little more use to the 'Motel 6' or one of the other well 
	known low rate motels. Josh and I did travel to a few nice hotels when he 
	got the promotions through work, but that was only because we stayed for 
	free or half price. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Carmen and I walked in silence to the front 
	desk. I think we both felt exhausted with everything that has been happening 
	recently. We waited for a moment at the desk when Carmen finally broke our 
	mutual silence saying, <i>&quot;Do you think we should have called or something? 
	I mean, they're not expecting us until another hour.&quot;&nbsp; </i>I told her 
	it was probably better that we just showed up. <i>&quot;It won't hurt to keep 
	them on their toes.&quot;&nbsp; </i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When the woman arrived to the front desk, 
	she gave an obvious fake smile and asked, <i>&quot;How can I help you ladies this 
	beautiful evening?&quot; </i>Carmen circled to face the lobby. I knew she turned 
	around so that 'Heather' (Which is what the woman's name tag read) wouldn't 
	see her laughing. Heather ruined the beauty of the place. Though she must 
	have been close to my age, if not younger, her skin looked worn and leathery. 
	Her platinum blonde hair was in huge curls billowing on her shoulders and 
	her make-up was way over done. Everything I have read in the magazines that 
	were labeled as, Fashion No-No's, Heather mistook as Fashion Know-how's.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I told Heather that we were suprising some 
	friends who had come to visit. <i>&quot;Their names are David Andrews and Marcus 
	Jacobs. They have two other friends with them, do you need their names as 
	well?&quot; </i>Heather continued her fake smile and said, <i>&quot;Please hold on for 
	one moment, Thank you!&quot; </i>Her false fingernails were all I could hear 
	clicking against the keyboard of her computer. She must have been typing in 
	their names to locate them. She stared at the screen of her computer and 
	said, <i>&quot;Hmmmmm....Could I ask you ladies to make yourselves comfortable in 
	our 'Great Room?' I need a moment to make one quick phone call before I can 
	proceed.&quot; </i>Carmen turned back around to face Heather. She said, <i>&quot;But 
	if you call them, it won't be a suprise.&quot; </i>Heather never lost her phony 
	smile since we arrived. Her cheeks must have been killing her. She replied 
	to Carmen, <i>&quot;I'm truly sorry ma'am. But here at the Staybridge Suites, we 
	are obligated to the privacy of our guests. Especially those whom occupy 
	more that one suite on our 'Excutive-Club Floor'.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Our plan to suprise them at their suite 
	doors was apparently not going to happen. I told Heather when she makes the 
	call to tell Andrews or Jacobs to send down Josh and Diego. <i>&quot;Josh and 
	Diego?&quot; </i>Heather repeated in a confused tone. <i>&quot;Trust me,&quot;</i> I said.
	<i>&quot;They'll know what It means&quot; </i>She stared at Carmen and I for a moment. 
	Then we walked into the huge room with the fireplace.&nbsp; I could only assume 
	this was the 'Great Room.' We didn't sit. We stood with our backsides to the 
	fireplace warming our rears. There was one other person in the room, an 
	older gentleman, maybe in his 60's. He was sitting to our left, lost in a 
	novel. I watched Heather nodding her head up and down, and glancing over at 
	us while she was on the phone. She still wore her phony smile. After a brief 
	conversation on the phone, she hung up the receiver and walk away.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Just when I was getting 
	suspicious as to why she would just leave, I saw the most handsome face come 
	from around the corner. It was Josh. Diego followed behind him. I ran over 
	and gave Josh a big hug. It felt like I hadn't seen him in years. <i>&quot;How's 
	my girl?&quot; </i>he said to me.<i> &quot;Better now that your in my arms.&quot;</i> I 
	said back to him. Diego had his arm around Carmen's waist. <i>&quot;We should get 
	back upstairs, there is a good plan waiting to happen.&quot;</i> Diego said 
	motioning for us all to follow. Josh and I held hands as we headed for the 
	Grand Staircase. I was incredibly eager now to share with the Agents, Kaleb 
	and Megan's whereabouts. Hopefully they will be included in 'the plan.' If 
	not, I can only hope Mr. </span>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Isakova will find them.</span></p>
