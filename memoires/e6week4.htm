    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Hamilton, Steward 
    and Dr. Tachikawa were applauding enthusiastically. Big smiles from ear to 
    ear. I was given a glass of water to drink because this recall had made me 
    thirsty. I couldn’t wait to give an extensive account of my experience, 
    which turned out to be Dave’s memory. The upload had taken no more than 
    three minutes but it took me ten minutes to recount all that I had smelled, 
    felt and seen. The next three quarters of an hour, at least, I shared 
    everything I knew about Matthew and Nancy and how I related to these people. 
    If Matthew wasn’t such a good friend I would certainly try to seduce her. 
    Now it was just embraces and the odd wink. What I could tell about Matthew 
    is that he is an estate agent and that we’ve been friends since he has sold 
    me a house. The couple had brought me along for a long weekend and we had 
    walked for quite a long time in the park. It was lovely, three friends 
    enjoying the freedom of nature. I felt really happy and content. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Hamilton wanted to 
    know more details, like the last names of the friends, the date of our 
    outing and the color of Nancy’s eyes. There seemed to be no end to his 
    questioning and I was amazed at how many questions I was able to answer. For 
    once there was no standard list of questions. Answers I gave led to new 
    questions. Everybody was cheerful and we were quite surprised to see it was 
    already six in the evening. <i>“We’ll continue tomorrow,”</i> Dr. Hamilton 
    suggested against all expectations and then he got up. Nobody probably would 
    have minded if we had continued for another hour and Dr. Hamilton would 
    usually want to go on himself. <i>“I have a dinner appointment with Mrs. 
    Duval,”</i> he explained, sighing <i>“and I need to get ready.”</i> Another 
    dinner with the lady from California! I wonder how far Dr. Hamilton is 
    willing to go to get for some extra budget for his project! </span></p>
