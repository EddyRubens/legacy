    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Adelle has been 
    irritating me enormously. Though I must confess that my first opinion of her 
    was perhaps a bit too negative. Okay, Adelle is an arrogant bitch with a 
    disgusting smell of perfume around her and I get gooseflesh every time I 
    hear her talk. But she can’t help it that she has such an irritating voice. 
    I assume she can’t get plastic surgery on that one. The things she says are 
    less annoying than I expected. At one time we discussed the development of 
    mankind. How we are able to have that in our own hands. The rebuilding of 
    mankind. That is a subject we discuss quite often. But I have never heard 
    someone talking about in such a funny and dry way. Unfortunately I can’t 
    remember what she said. If good humor is a sign of intelligence, this lady 
    is less stupid than I thought. She seems to adapt herself a bit. Today she 
    was wearing jeans, the most common uniform on earth. Does she want to be one 
    of us? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Even though Adelle 
    isn’t such a disaster as I first thought, I prefer not to have her around 
    me. I have to sneeze every time, because of her perfume. <i>“Oh, dear. Are 
    you still having that cold?”</i> she asks every time. </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton doesn’t 
    mind her odor. It’s almost as if they’re in love, the way I see them lately. 
    At least they seem to have a lot to talk about. It would be very welcome, 
    actually. That way Dr. Tachikawa and I would no longer have the full 
    attention of the grapevine.</span></b></p>
