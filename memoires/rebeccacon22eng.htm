    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It seems not a day 
    goes by without something interesting happening. This morning, Carmen had an 
    appointment to get her first upload. I was walking with her because she 
    wanted to talk to Dr. Hamilton about me being in the room with her. She 
    seemed so nervous and excited at the same time. In fact we ended up arriving 
    at the room a half hour early! I offered to go get some mini muffins from 
    the vending machine but she insisted she was to excited to eat. So we 
    decided to just stand out in the hall and talk until it was time to go 
    inside. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After being there for 
    not even two minutes, we heard a scream from down the hall. It wasn't a 
    'pain' sort of scream it was more of a 'fear' scream. We ran down the hall 
    to see what was going on. A few minutes passed and that's when we saw Sheila 
    walk out of a room with an odd look on her face. Carmen asked, <i>&quot;Is 
    everything OK?&quot;</i> Sheila said is a very mellow tone, <i>&quot;Everything is 
    under control. Nothing to worry about, just......a misunderstanding.&quot;</i> 
    She gave me a look like she wanted to say something to me about the letter I 
    wrote her, but I think Carmen's presence restrained her from continuing. (Thank 
    God!) &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She asked us to go 
    back down the hall. She said she would be there soon to get things started 
    for Carmen. <i>&quot;Is Dr. Hamilton going to come out here soon?&quot;</i> Carmen 
    asked. <i>&quot;I have something I'd like to ask him,&quot;</i> she continued. <i>&quot;If 
    you have any questions you can ask me.&quot; </i>Sheila said. Carmen looked at me 
    with a look I understood. It was the look verifying that she had one nerve 
    left, and Sheila was bouncing on it! <i><br>
    &quot;Sheila,&quot;</i> I said, <i>&quot;if it's all the same to you, I think it might be 
    something personal and......I wanted to talk to you anyway.&quot;</i> By the look 
    on Carmen's face I could see she was happy that I jumped in and said 
    something. However, I was mad at myself for saying I wanted to talk to her! 
    That was the last thing I wanted to do! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;Very well,&quot;</i> 
    she said <i>&quot;Let me just get Carmen positioned comfortably in the chair, run 
    through the procedures with her and then we'll go to my office. You do 
    understand we are going to have to make it short. I have to be back her for 
    Carmen's upload.&quot; &quot;Oh... I understand!&quot;</i> I said smiling. The shorter the 
    better is what I was really thinking.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial"> </span>
