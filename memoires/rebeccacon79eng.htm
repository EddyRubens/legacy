	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I got out of the shower, I went looking 
	for Josh. I decided that I had to tell him about everything I knew as soon 
	as I saw him. I didn't want anything to sidetrack me. When I found him, he 
	was in the kitchen area of the suite. He was serving up two bowls of soup. 
	He smiled at me when I walked out in his baggy clothes and said, <i>&quot;Now 
	that's what I want you to wear on our honeymoon!&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I couldn't bring myself to smile this time. 
	I had so much on my mind. Josh walked over to me and took me by my hands. <i>
	&quot;Look,&quot;</i> he said, <i>&quot;The Agents said that you can stay here for the 
	night and we'll figure something out tomorrow. You can relax sweetie!&quot; 
	&quot;That's just it Josh,&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;Why do we have to do everything the 
	agents say? If they say jump, why do we have to say how high? I want to 
	leave here, Josh. Just you and me. We can sneak out of here tonight. I know 
	other people who can help us. We don't have to depend on these Agents. 
	Besides, they're not even willing to help Megan! Why should we trust them to 
	help us?&quot; </i>Josh stared at me with a look that was crossed with 
	disappointment and confusion. He didn't say anything for a long time, he 
	just stared at me. My only guess was he was trying to absorb the reality I 
	just flashed in his face. Finally, I begged him to say something He shook 
	his head from side to side and said, &quot;<i>The agents said something like this 
	might happen to you.&quot; &quot;What do you mean something like this?&quot; </i>I said in 
	a snappy tone. <i>&quot;Baby,&quot;</i> Josh continued. <i>&quot;I think this thing in your 
	head has made you paranoid! The agents said that you might start saying 
	things that sound crazy.&quot; </i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">He went over to the kitchen counter and 
	picked up three little white pills. He got a glass of water and walked over 
	to me. <i>&quot;Here, I want you to take these.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;They'll help 
	you calm down.&quot; &quot;Josh,&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;Your acting like I'm out of control! 
	I just want you to step back and look at the big picture.&quot;</i> He repeated 
	himself and asked me to take the pills. He was starting to make me angry. I 
	had never seen him act like this before. Josh would never take someone 
	else's side over mine. I wondered what the Agents did or said to make him 
	act that way. He asked me one more time to take the pills. When he held his 
	hand out with the pills in it, I swung my hand out slapped it. The three 
	little white pills went flying across the room. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial"><i>&quot;Rebecca, What the hell are you doing?&quot;</i> 
	Josh yelled. <i>&quot;Have you lost your mind?&quot;</i> I was so tired and angry that 
	I just started laughing. <i>&quot;Yea, Josh,&quot; </i>I said. <i>&quot;I lost my 
	mind...I'm crazy! &quot;</i> I pushed around him and went in the bedroom to get 
	my things. I decided I was going to leave whether he and the Agents liked it 
	or not. </span></p>
