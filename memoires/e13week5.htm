    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">My 
    first presentation went really well. Jeanine had organized a little corner 
    right by the entrance of the university. I had fun brightening it up with 
    some Braintec flags. I put up a small table with a computer and the 
    brochures Patrick made for me. It looked good. I enjoyed showing it to 
    people and I think my enthusiasm was contagious. A lot of people showed an 
    interest and some even applied. Let’s hope that one of them will go through 
    with it and become a test subject. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">My intro talk is set 
    on auto pilot now, but still feels fresh. <i>“Would you like me to give you 
    a short introduction to Braintec, or would you prefer to look around on your 
    own?”</i> Depending on their answer I then continue or let them go ahead. 
    When I continue it goes like this<i>: “Braintec is an American company that 
    researches the re-experiencing of memories. This is our research center and 
    this is the director.”</i> I then show them the brochure and point to the 
    pictures. <i>“For our research we use two types of brain implant. Test 
    subjects who get a small implant, the MSI, can only re-experience memories 
    of other people. While with the larger implant, the MESI, it’s also possible 
    to copy memories from the brain and upload them in small plates, which are 
    called M-stores.”</i> People then gaze at the pictures and soon stare at me 
    in utter amazement. <i>“Braintec is not organizing this research to 
    entertain the test subjects – although I can assure you it is an amazing 
    experience – but to gain more insight into how the brain processes memories, 
    because we still know very little about that. If we know how our brains 
    store information and especially how it’s held, we may possibly develop a 
    cure for Alzheimer’s or dementia.”</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">That’s usually the 
    point when all the questions come. <i>”Yes, but isn’t that dangerous?”&nbsp; “How 
    does it work then?” ”Where do they put the implant?”</i> People got a kick 
    out of looking at my bald spot with its scars and imagine the implant in my 
    head. But the idea of actually getting one is a bit frightening to them and 
    stops them from checking it out further. But if I then explain there’s a 
    free trip to Portland thrown in and that they can earn $5240, - if they stay 
    there for four weeks, it suddenly becomes a lot more attractive. Some people 
    told me that they find their own memories are more than enough to deal with 
    and somebody even asked me if it’s possible to remove bad memories from the 
    brain. That woman found it very disappointing to hear that <i>“we only work 
    with good memories and do not provide therapeutic treatments.” </i></span>
    </p>

    Anyway, the presentation job is fun. Jeanine came by a couple of times to 
    bring me a cup of coffee. What a sweetie! She smiled when she saw I was 
    having such a good time. <i>“You look awful though. A real bimbo.”</i> she 
    joked. She’s right, of course, I look like a stewardess in my Braintec 
    outfit. But it’s important that I look representative.</span></p>
