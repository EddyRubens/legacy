    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    have been intensively trained in the guidance of new test subjects. It is, 
    above all, very important to give faith and to be trusted. Besides that I 
    give explanations where necessary and I give people the feeling that they 
    are welcome. I understand the importance of these goals, it all seems 
    logical. But I really don’t see how to realize this. How can I reassure 
    confused or worried test subjects when I am also confused every now and then? 
    I haven’t forgotten the epileptic seizure and such. I can still become 
    frightened when I think that it might be possible that the colors disappear 
    again one of these days. And I definitely don’t want to lie about this. How 
    could they ever foist this off on me? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In spite of that, it 
    still attracts me, to guide new test subjects. Before I decided to become an 
    artist, I considered getting a Diploma in Education. Teaching seems to be 
    fun and is maybe not so different from guiding. </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">This afternoon the first 
    group of new test subjects will arrive. It is a group of five; three men and 
    two women. Their planes won’t land at the same time, so I’ll get them, one 
    by one, under my wing. I’ve read their dossiers well. One woman, Sonja 
    Boutoille, is from Belgium. Her name sounds Walloon, but even then she still 
    might speak Dutch. I’ve communicated in Dutch regularly on the Internet and 
    by e-mail but I haven’t spoken it since ages. Except those few times I 
    phoned home. If I make a quick calculation, I easily get one and a half year 
    if I count my time in Greenland added to those ten weeks here at Braintec! 
    &nbsp;I really look forward to talk to Sonja in Dutch, if she speaks that 
    language.</span></p>
