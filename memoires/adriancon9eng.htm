    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">We have 
    done a lot of work recently. Tachikawa is creating a new kind of M-store and 
    he regularly asks me for advice to keep it compatible with my DOSS. He is a 
    very considerate man and once he asked me if I am still pleased. We started 
    to talk and to fantasise about the possibilities to use the M-stores outside 
    the institute. We encountered the same problem over and over again, the 
    absence of the possibility to extract the images out of the memory and to 
    store them as an independent file. Unfortunately I can’t find a solution to 
    realise this. Maybe there is someone else in this world that can. I should 
    see: “Come to Portland and the whole world lies at your feet.”</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">My 
    last upload was a very exiting one. It was a teambuilding activity from 
    Michael. Something out of the time he spent in the army. With a group of 
    seven men inside an underground cave</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; color: black"><b>. 
    It was pitch-dark, gore, wet and very narrow there. This all might sound a 
    bit scary, but strange enough nobody felt any fear. We all counted at each 
    other and we helped each other to find a way to the exit. We worked our way 
    through, hand in hand through the most narrow fissures and passages. 
    Sometimes we had to drop us down in good luck, knowing that someone else was 
    waiting for us some feet below in the pitch-dark to catch us. And what a 
    release when we reached the exit. No, it was never really scary, but it made 
    an attempt on my condition. It really did. After this re-experience I was 
    dead tired, but very happy.</b> </span></p>

    Later on, Michael told me that this trip took over four hours. My 
    remembrance took only a couple of minutes. Besides that I was so tired, that 
    I spend the rest of the day lying exhausted at the inner yard of the center, 
    resting.</span></p>
