    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">A 
    fantastic memory! This afternoon I’ve got one of Robberts’ memories uploaded. 
    A memory of his childhood. It was an amusement park, probably Disneyland. 
    Nowadays I wouldn’t go to one of those parks, but this way I had a wonderful 
    time. So much authenticity is hard to find in a real experience. I felt 
    enormous enthusiasm; the elation of a young child. I used to go to amusement 
    parks when I was a child too, but I don’t remember it having such an 
    impression on me. The pure happiness in a world where you can have anything 
    you wish for. An ice-cream you can only dream of. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">If I think about the 
    images of the upload, I find them not so alluring. The emotions made it so 
    powerful. I was over emotional during this session that I had a sore throat 
    and I almost fell down through weakness. Even now, when the memory is still 
    on my mind, I become emotional again. I can easily burst into tears if I 
    want to. The memory gave me such a peaceful and happy feeling; I can’t 
    remember ever feeling so comfortable. This emotion might be similar to 
    happiness. I could feel this warm intensity from my fingertips to the 
    deepest spot in my belly. Did Robbert feel the same when he was a child? 
    Unfortunately for him he did not. Previous uploads of Robberts’ memory 
    always gave me a good feeling, but this exceeded everything. And when 
    Robbert got his own amusement-park-memory uploaded yesterday, his reaction 
    wasn’t that special at all. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jessica took much 
    more time than usual for the interview after my upload. I am happy she did. 
    This experience is so radical that I feel the urge to speak about it. My 
    emotional response might tell us more about my current state of mind than 
    about the memory. Maybe this upload put a finger upon a weak spot. It brings 
    up the thing I miss the most: sense of security and trust.</span></p>
