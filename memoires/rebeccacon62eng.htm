    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen and I returned 
    to the booth where we first arrived. They let us in first, and they sat on 
    the ends of the 'U' shaped booth. <i>&quot;We have done a lot of planning.&quot;</i> 
    Agent Andrew started. <i>&quot;If all goes accordingly, we should have Matsushita...or 
    Tachikawa as you know him, apprehended within a few days.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;Excuse me...I know 
    you seem to have everything planned, but... I think there is something you 
    should know.&quot;</i> I interrupted and said. <i>&quot;Kaleb and Megan are missing. I 
    went to both of their rooms personally. Both of them and all of their 
    belongings are gone.&quot;</i> Agent Andrews got a worried look on his face. He 
    said to Agent Jacobs, <i>&quot;Make the call.&quot;</i> Agent Jacobs left the table 
    while dialing a number on his cell phone. <i>&quot;What can you tell me about 
    Isakova and Desmond?&quot; </i>Agent Andrews said to me. <i>&quot;Well,...&quot;</i> I 
    started. <i>&quot;Megan wrote me a disturbing email last night. She mentioned how 
    Dr. Tachikawa was physically forceful to her , bruising her arms and her 
    tailbone. She also mentioned an experimental extraction he had planned for 
    her today. I know she fears for her life and the safety of her family. When 
    I went to help her, before I came here, she was gone. Her room was totally 
    empty.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;What about Desmond?&quot;</i> 
    He said. <i>&quot;Kaleb?&quot;</i> I asked. <i>&quot;MmmHmm&quot;</i> Agent Andrews responded. I 
    wasn't sure if I should tell him that Kaleb told Carmen and I he was 
    undercover. I didn't want him to get in any kind of trouble but I was also 
    worried for his safe well being. I searched for a quick answer but nothing 
    came. Agent Andrews said, <i>&quot;Agent Desmond has informed us that the two of 
    you know of his status. If you are afraid to give information about him, 
    there is no need to worry. We last had contact with him about three o'clock. 
    He informed us that the two of you were scheduled for uploads.&quot;</i> Carmen 
    said, <i>&quot;Yea, but where is he now?&quot; &quot;Agent Jacobs is making a call to him 
    as we speak. I'm sure he's fine. He has had the best training the government 
    has to offer.&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;But what about Megan?&quot;</i> Carmen added.&nbsp;<i> 
    &quot;She stuck in this just like us. How do we know she's going to be OK?&quot; &quot;I 
    can't guarantee anything Miss. Castillo. I can only hope for the best or do 
    my damnedest trying.&quot; </i>Agent Andrews answered. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Agent Jacobs returned 
    to the table. <i>&quot;Well?&quot;</i> Agent Andrews said. <i>&quot;I tried and tried but 
    there is no answer.&quot;</i> Agent Jacobs said. <i>&quot;I called headquarters and 
    let them know Agent Desmond is 'MIA.' If he should contact them, any calls 
    will be forwarded to us.&quot; &quot;Do you think I should contact Megan's family?&quot;</i> 
    I said. <i>&quot;She gave me their address and told me to please contact them if 
    anything were to happen to her.&quot; &quot;We can't be sure anything has happened to 
    her.&quot;</i> Agent Andrews said. <i>&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;</i> I said. I 
    couldn't help but get mad. <i>&quot;Megan has been physically, mentally and 
    emotionally abused. She was locked in a small confined room and probably has 
    had some sort of experimental extraction done to her. You don't think that's 
    something?&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;Miss Reynolds, 
    first of all, please lower your voice and calm down.&quot; </i>Agent Andrews said.
    <i>&quot;We deal with this sort of thing all the time and feel it's never good to 
    involve the family unless we feel a particular party in serious danger. We 
    will handle things accordingly.&quot; &quot;Look I appreciate that you were worried 
    enough about Carmen and I to contact Josh and Diego. But, we're not the ones 
    missing. So, doesn't it make sense to you...to maybe let her family know 
    what the hell is going on?&quot; </i>Both the Agents stared at me. I think they 
    both knew I was right. It didn't matter anyhow. I figured when I got back to 
    the facility I would write them regardless. I had to do it for Megan. I know 
    she would do it for me.</span></p>
