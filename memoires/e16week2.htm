    Steward’s damaged memory which Steve experienced as the first one created a 
    commotion for everybody. Since this morning a gossip is heard that the 
    M-Store in which this memory is filed has been used again. Steward’s dull 
    boat-trip was said to be recorded over a delicate adventure. I do not know 
    exactly who came up with this idea but everybody was flabbergasted. Whose 
    delicate memory and how he got this idea about that M-Store? Are they 
    experiencing with other things apart from the program that I do not know of? 
    According to Sally’s claims, it is Dr. Tachikawa who is experiencing all 
    sorts of strange ideas. She is sure, for a 98%, that traces of that former 
    upload are heading his direction. Steward, however, denies it. During al 
    that time the M-Stores have been under his supervision and impossibly have 
    been used for other purposes. He surely would have noticed that.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">During the day gossips 
    were getting more and more extreme. That’s why a meeting was held urgently. 
    I was allowed to attend it because after that I had to inform the other test 
    subjects. It was the weirdest meeting I ever attended. Dr. Tachikawa was 
    sitting opposite me. I could not help watching him. He must have noticed 
    that. Nevertheless he neglected me completely. I could see on his face that 
    he does not sleep too well. Although he looked ten years older he seemed to 
    be happy. Has he fallen under the spell of all those developments he had 
    made or is he preoccupied by Jessica?&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton opened 
    the meeting. <i>“Time is over and done with it. All this is of great danger 
    to the belief and the continuation of our project!”</i> I have never seen 
    such a serious director. He severely looked at us one by one and continued.
    <i>“Each one of you knows exactly what I mean.”</i> Dr. Tachikawa played 
    with his tea. Did Dr. Hamilton really look at him longer than the rest of us? 
    Or did it seem so? <i>“The gossips going about of the corrupted M-Store,”</i> 
    Dr. Hamilton continued, <i>“...are absolutely unfair and not based on facts. 
    As a matter of fact an M-Store is not a floppy disk. You cannot allow 
    yourself to add and delete memories on it as you please. That is completely 
    nonsense. It is quite clear to me that something is wrong with this M-Store. 
    Probably it happened during the extraction.”</i> Steward suddenly sat 
    straight like he was struck by lightening and stared at Dr. Hamilton with 
    big eyes. <i>“But there is no proof of that.”</i> Dr.Hamilton gave a signal 
    to Steward he should wait in order giving any reaction. <i>“Such gossips are 
    very threatening to our company and should be eliminated immediately. And 
    also we have to make sure that in future there will be no reasons any more 
    for such imaginations. Today the M-Store concerned will be destroyed and 
    tomorrow morning we delete Steward’s implant.”</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>The members of the 
    board were talking around the subject. It was hard to follow all 
    conversations at the same time but most of them agreed upon Dr. Hamilton. 
    Except Steward. <i>“With all respect…”</i> he started with a loud voice to 
    be heard between all the loud talking. <i>“I do not see any reason for 
    removing my implant!”</i> Steward looked like a child being kept under house 
    arrest for no reason. <i>“Dear Mark,” </i>Dr. Hamilton replied in a friendly 
    but authoritative way, <i>“...don’t you think that your implant is in your 
    head way too long? Your MESI is one of the first proto-types and you know 
    for sure that it is very unhealthy to keep it in your head for such a long 
    time. Whether you agree with me or not: Tomorrow morning we will take it 
    out.”</i> Steward, broken into his spirits, simply gazed in front of him. 
    Dr. Hamilton’s words struck me as well. ‘Coss just like Steward I have a 
    first type of MESI. Could it be dangerous? Does my implant also need to be 
    removed? I do not hope so!</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
