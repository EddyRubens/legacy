    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I reached the 
    front of the airport there was a man standing there with a sign in his hand. 
    He was holding it down at his side as though he was tired of holding it in 
    the air.&nbsp; When I looked at my watch I realized I was about twenty-five 
    minutes late.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After I finished 
    eating, I was distracted by a woman who decided to have an argument in the 
    middle of the airport.&nbsp; <i>&quot;How dare you walk out on me...and with her of 
    all people!&quot;</i> she shouted <i>&quot;I'll take everything you've got!&quot; </i>&nbsp;I 
    was amused at the vulgar remarks she screamed across the airport as her 
    husband (I'm assuming) walked away with some woman. Don't get me wrong I 
    don't take pleasure in the misfortune of others, I just take pleasure in the 
    fact that they would choose to humiliate themselves in front of hundreds of 
    complete strangers.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Anyhow, when I 
    approached the man with the sign I tried to apologize for my tardiness. He 
    just said <i>&quot;MmmHmm&quot;</i> and took my suitcases.&nbsp; I followed him out to the 
    car and filled him in on the commotion that took place over by the Wendy's. 
    He didn't seem to amused so I decide to just drop the subject.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The ride to the 
    facility was nice. I enjoyed the scenery along the way. I didn't talk to the 
    driver much. I don't think he liked me to well.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When we arrived to the 
    building I started to get butterflies in my stomach.&nbsp; There were a few other 
    people sitting inside this little room with all there luggage beside them. I 
    assumed they were new here too. I said <i>&quot;Hi&quot;</i> to a few people but 
    nobody was really in the mood for conversation. I couldn't blame them, they 
    were probably nervous too.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">A woman came in the 
    room and introduced herself as Rosanne (She was the girl from the airplane 
    and the web site). She said she would take us to our rooms and let us get 
    settled. Then in a few hours we would receive a tour and meet the staff. 
    When I was shown my room, I was told I would meet my roommate later. She 
    apparently went in for her first tests today. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">That leaves me to 
    right now. I am sitting on a single bed looking across at my new roommates 
    stuff. She has a huge diamond studded red pillow on her bed which reads 
    Carmen across it. I hope we will get along as well as Carrie and I did in 
    college. I guess I'll soon find out!</span></p>
