    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Where should we go this time? Every 
    place can be dangerous and insecure. A lot of people seem to be interested 
    in the information I’m carrying. We give the driver the card one of our 
    guests, Yukio, gave us. We trust him the most. At that address he seems to 
    be working at a big multimedia project. It is huge and quit interesting what 
    Yukio’s building there. With the help of the available equipment we make a 
    back-up from all the information stored on my laptop. This way Heather can 
    have it on a disk in case anything happens to me. It should be in code, 
    because a lot of strange figures appear on the screens. Heather and I don’t 
    want to go back to the guesthouse but prefer to take our planes without 
    catching the eye. We ask Yukio to pick up our belongings. He needs to go to 
    the guesthouse for some tools anyway. If he sees that other people have been 
    in our room, he only has to take what we stored in the storage room. We 
    enjoy his flashy installation when he’s gone. My laptop images fit in so 
    well. This way I become part of an artwork! &nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">After one hour Yukio is back. He 
    only took our belongings from the storage room. It’s obvious that there has 
    been some activity inside our room. Yukio describes the people he saw 
    sitting in the room next to ours and one white skinned man in a house across 
    the guesthouse. Yukio couldn’t see them clearly but it has to be the 
    Brainteccers and Paul. An extra reason to be careful.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">It doesn’t matter that we miss our 
    luggage from our room. We have enough clothes by now and the artworks we 
    bought and other things that we care for were all in the storage room. But 
    how to go on? Yukio sends us to the owner of an art institute, Mitsuki. She 
    has often sent all kinds of things for exhibitions. We pack it like art and 
    Mitsuki should ship it to our both home addresses today. Now we only have to 
    sneak out of here. At our arrival in Japan I saw a separated entrance for 
    business class. If we exchange our tickets we can use that one. </font></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial">Then I think that the payment could be a 
    problem. Paul could possibly follow us if we pay with the credit card and 
    paying in cash is somehow suspicious. Mitsuki has a solution for this as 
    well. She shall pay the extra costs electronically and we shall pay the 
    costs to her with the credit card right before we leave. We can even sleep 
    at her place. She lives above the institute. We have a nice evening. Great 
    food and interesting conversations mostly about Japanese literature.</span></p>
