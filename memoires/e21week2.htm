    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>In between 
    appointments I saw Davel close to the vending machines. He drank a can of 
    coke and stepped aside so I could get a tonic. He laughed at me. He smiled 
    in a pleasant way. <i>“Are you alright?”</i> I asked careless. <i>“Perfect!”</i> 
    Davel answered. <i>“Can’t be better. Although my head is still loaded with 
    questions.”</i> Davel always wants to ask and understand everything. When I 
    take my time he tells me endless stories. But seldom something concrete. <i>
    “Do you think you’ve almost reached the core of this big mystery?”</i> I 
    probably asked him this a bit too sarcastic. Davel opened and closed his 
    mouth several times. He looked like a fish making bubbles. I felt sorry for 
    him. Maybe I was too harsh with him. I wanted to pet him on his head but 
    rubbed his shoulder when I found out his head was much taller than mine. Has 
    he grown, not again? Such a bundle of muscles!&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">My hand was resting on 
    his shoulder a bit too long, it seemed so. Perhaps Davel thought it was on 
    purpose. He held me tight. Less tight than last week but still enough not to 
    escape from his hands. He kissed me. His soft lips opened and a wet kiss 
    followed. I felt it itching in my stomach. Too nice to stop it. I shortly 
    kissed back. I liked it but even though I pushed him away. It was not 
    appropriate.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“Tonight Dr. 
    Tachikawa is coming back,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> I 
    said. This remark really didn’t make sense. For both of us. Why did I tell 
    him that, at such a moment? Davel stared at the ground confused. Our eyes 
    met for a second when he walked away. <i>“Good for you,”</i> I overheard 
    just in time. What a fool I am! I really like Davel! He’s a nice boy, so why 
    did I act so stupid? Was it a Freudian remark? Kodjiro’s absence didn’t 
    strike me because of Davel. But this Japanese mystery still has a warm spot 
    in my heart. That’s why there’s no destination for Davel. Not in this way.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    saw Dr. Tachikawa getting out of the taxi carrying two suitcases. I offered 
    him a hand in the lobby. <i>“No thanks,”</i> he answered grumpy. He had 
    returned showing his bad mood. </span></p>
