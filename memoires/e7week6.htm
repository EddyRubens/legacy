    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Braintec still has to 
    find a solution for that stupid shaving. For a good upload it is important 
    that the hair growth doesn’t interrupt the server. I’ve got a bold spot 
    diagonal above my left ear and every day it has to be shaven to delete the 
    new coming stubbles. That’s usually Jessica’s job. Until now she shaved me 
    very carefully, but today she hit the scarves for at least three times.
    </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">And that hurts, of course. 
    I suspect her for doing that on purpose. The little wounds are now open 
    again. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">And I was just so happy to be 
    free of band-aid. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I think I will adapt my 
    haircut if I continue being a test subject. At this moment you can hardly 
    see the bold spot because my long hair covers it. Actually I like it this 
    way. But I find the shaving so annoying, especially when someone else has to 
    do it for me. Some people might find it a pleasant thing, that fiddling 
    about with your hair, but I really hate it. That’s why I never go to the 
    hairdresser, yuck! If I stay here long enough and if the surgical wounds are 
    completely healed, I might suggest shaving it myself. I might perhaps shave 
    the whole left side of my head, for convenience. Like I used to do when I 
    was an adolescent and tried to find a way to compare my inner feelings with 
    my outside. A lovely feeling, I remember, when the wind blows over fresh 
    shaven skin. </span></p>
