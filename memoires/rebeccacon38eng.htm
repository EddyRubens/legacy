    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was a little nervous 
    to open the letter sent by the CIA. I decided to read my other emails first. 
    Josh's letter was sweet as usual. He told me Bruce was doing fine and he 
    mentioned that he stays at my place a few nights out of the week so Bruce 
    feels more comfortable. The other nights, he takes Bruce to his house. I am 
    so lucky to have met Josh! I think I am even more lucky that the feeling of 
    love is mutual!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The second letter I 
    had was from Megan. It read;<br>
    <i>&quot;Rebecca, I'm sorry that I was so forward and blunt with you earlier, 
    especially since I hadn't seen you in such a long time.&nbsp; It's just that Dr. 
    Hamilton has been keeping me isolated from the other test subjects. I was on 
    my way to his office when I saw you. You are the only person I slightly know 
    here. I guess I just got over excited. Please don't mention to anyone that I 
    spoke to you. I could get in big trouble with Dr. Hamilton and Dr. Tachikawa. 
    I will keep in touch as long as it remains a secret. This is my personal 
    email address. No one knows that I have it but you. You can reach me here. I 
    hope to hear from you soon.&nbsp; Megan&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I wrote Megan back;
    <br>
    <i>&quot;Megan, I want you to know that you can trust me. I will share with you 
    that have been feeling a bit frightened here. I have been thinking of 
    leaving. </i></span><i><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Are you in 
    some kind of trouble with the doctors? Is there anything I can do to help? 
    Maybe you and I should meet sometime and talk. I know of a place in the 
    Japanese Gardens where nobody would see us. You are not alone! Please write 
    soon.&nbsp; Rebecca&quot;</span></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Carmen is not 
    the only on that has problems here. I am feeling more and more uncomfortable 
    at Braintec. I really want to leave, but not without Carmen. Now, I also 
    feel a bit obligated to Megan as well. What have I gotten myself into? <br>
    Time to eat. The CIA email will have to wait</span></p>
