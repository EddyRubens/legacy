	<span style="font-family:Arial">The impossible didn't seem so far off now 
	that I know Carmen is here. But, as I sit and type I wonder what is going on 
	in the minds of Josh and Diego. They both seemed so concerned for our well 
	being, and now they have sent us back to Hell. There is has got to be 
	something or someone behind all of this. My feelings of betrayal have 
	subsided and now I am actually worried for Josh. I have known him for so 
	many years and I know without a doubt, that he would never put me in harms 
	way. I decided to email him, hoping for a response. My letter to him reads:</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">&quot;Josh,<br>
	I feel deep down that you have come here, with the hopes of getting me out 
	of this mess. But, I think you may have gotten yourself in to trouble as 
	well. I have known you for such a long time and can honestly say, your 
	actions last night were completely out of character. An awful thing happened 
	to someone extremely close to me and you seemed to act as though it was no 
	big deal, insisting a shower would make everything better. Then, when I only 
	tried to explain how I was feeling and what I knew you perceived it as me 
	losing my mind. What exactly were those pills Josh? Did you even know, or 
	was it something the 'agents' told you to give me? Then to top it off and 
	make things worse, you let two strange men attack me. I don't understand how 
	you were able to stand by and watch as the 'agents' forced me to the ground 
	and injected me with some foreign fluid. Where is your mind Josh? Is it in 
	the same place as you heart? Please write me back and help me to understand 
	what is happening. I still love you!<br>
