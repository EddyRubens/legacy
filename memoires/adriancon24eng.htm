    <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">After the extraction this 
    morning new post was waiting for me in my room. Two letters from friends 
    from Elgin and a package. I was curious about the package, but decided to 
    read the letters first. Questions from Scotland when to come home. It makes 
    me a bit melancholic. Some desires for home. Nicely sailing at the North sea. 
    Short tracks around the coast. A cross to the Netherlands. Or making 
    beautiful hikes across the coast. That rest is hard to find around here. 
    Summer is arriving and it starts to itch. I can rent a boat here as well, 
    but sailing with a couple of good old mates is much cozier. Suddenly I must 
    think about that upload a while ago. Going my own way, was the motto. It 
    seems to be too difficult to decide. And more choices are added all the 
    time.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
    package comes from Belgium. I can see that at the stamps. But the content is 
    Japanese. I open it with trembling fingers. A postcard, Greetings From Tokyo, 
    signed by Kodjiro, Rosanne and Jessica. No sign of Sonja yet. A ticket to 
    Tokyo and last but best: A whole box of M-stores. Two trays of twelve pieces 
    each. Is that Kodjiro becoming insane? What do I have to do with this. 
    Consume it or erase it immediately in the microwave? I hide them safely in 
    the lowest drawer of my desk. Far at the back, behind a couple of socks 
    smelling inexplicably awful. No one will find them there. Or do I have to 
    take them to the safe? They would be very out of reach there. I keep them 
    where they are now. Away but still close. Belgium, isn’t Sonja coming from 
    there? I don’t give it too much attention, but I can’t let go either. Is 
    this a track? Gosh, twenty-four M-stores in some kind of surprise package. 
    What would be on it? I am getting deadly curious, but I decide to keep them 
    away. I am scheduled for another upload tomorrow morning according to 
    Hamilton. I can wait for that. </span></p>
