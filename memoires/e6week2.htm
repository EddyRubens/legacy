    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">She can turn a mere roadside 
    restaurant into the coziest of places. Our conversations are becoming more 
    and more personal. Just the other day a couple changed tables because they 
    were too embarrassed overhearing our conversation. If I remember well we 
    were talking about our first orgasms that night. We exchanged our 
    experiences and laughed about the astonishment that came with those first 
    orgasms. Nobody had ever told us that that was possible. Also the 
    experiences with shower head, the washing machine’s spin dry function, and 
    even the food mixer were exchanged. I must try that food mixer some time, 
    sounds interesting! Jessica warned me, however, <i>“to keep in full control 
    of such a device during the moment supréme, otherwise something meant to 
    make you feel good could easily end in horrible disaster…”</i> We couldn’t 
    stop laughing; we were like a couple of giggly teenagers. It’s nice to have 
    a friend. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><i>
    “Whatever do we need men for anyway?”</i> she giggled. That was the moment 
    when the couple sitting at the opposite table took off. When you’re out with 
    Jessica, male company is indeed totally redundant. If one man is added to 
    the company, Jessica turns all hesitant and adopts a distant attitude. Her 
    openness immediately becomes limited and her spontaneous, sometimes naughty 
    remarks become a rarity. </span></p>
