    Rosanne, yesterday it was a big mess indeed. I was watching TV quietly when 
    all hell has broken loose. I can’t tell you how it started. If certain 
    people have a problem with each other, I usually pretend that I don’t hear 
    it or notice it. That’s the best. That’s wasn’t possible yesterday. Your pal 
    came down on Hamilton like a ton of bricks. Hamilton let him raze out his 
    fury. I’m not used to choosing sites, but in this situation I could only 
    support Hamilton. He is integer and I trust him more than I trust Tachikawa. 
    What do you fancy in that man? Are you the kind of girl that always goes for 
    the wrong men?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Whatever. 
    You had asked me what they were arguing about and you suggested writing it 
    down in this diary. The fight was about that writing, that publication in 
    the magazine, as you already thought. Tachikawa (Kodjiro) thinks that 
    Hamilton made the show with his findings. <i>His</i> findings. That goes 
    beyond that publication. Either there is much more going or Tachikawa is a 
    quick tempered hot-head. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I find 
    such a fight annoying as well. Who does find that it’s fun? Have you already 
    heard that I’m leaving? They’re going to remove my implant tomorrow and then 
    I’ll go home. When I’m recovered. What about you? For how long are you 
    staying at Braintec?</span></p>
