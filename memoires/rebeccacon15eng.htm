    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I packed all my things 
    and Carmen and I have moved into our new and much larger room. She is busy 
    putting away her things. She is dancing around the room with her CD walk man 
    on. I put on a fake smile whenever she looks at me, but I am afraid I feel 
    rather blue today. Since Carmen and Diego are so understanding of each other 
    and always seem to be on the same track, I choose not to mention my troubles 
    to her right now. Especially since she is so excited for tomorrow's surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I am feeling a bit 
    depressed because of the email I received from Josh this morning. He told me 
    that when he was walking Bruce, he ran into an old friend of his, Darcy. I 
    met her a while back when Josh and I were picking out a movie to rent. He 
    told me they made plans to go to dinner <i>&quot;...and whatever happens after 
    that.&quot; </i>Darcy is this big chested blonde who can attract any man she 
    wants by wearing a low cut shirt and doing this completely obnoxious giggle 
    while twirling her hair around her index finger. I told him the night I met 
    her, that I didn't like her. He just laughed and said <i>&quot;You don't like any 
    friends I have that are girls!&quot;</i> I denied that comment, even though it's 
    true.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">But, what would posses 
    him to write me saying that? He knows I like him! Is this just an attempt to 
    get me to come home? Honestly, it hurts my feelings that he would stoop to 
    this level. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">My surgery is tomorrow 
    and I have a lot I would like to get done before then. I want to unpack and 
    get things situated. I don't know how long my recovery will take, so I would 
    like things to be in order when I return from the 'Left Wing.' I will write 
    again when I return from the MESI implantation.</span></p>
