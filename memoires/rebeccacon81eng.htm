	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I woke up, I was in bed, in my room, at 
	Braintec. I have no idea how I got here. Honestly, the only thing I am 
	worried about right now, is the fact that I have no idea where Carmen is! 
	Luckily, all of her stuff is still here. They apparently haven't tried to 
	erase her existence yet. That seems to be what they do around here when 
	something goes wrong. I remember everything that happened last night, and 
	only hope that wherever she is, her and the baby are being well taken care 
	of. I'm sure that Diego wouldn't let anything bad happen to her, unless he's 
	a turncoat like Josh. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Beside from all the commotion that happened, 
	I am feeling betrayed by Josh. I can't believe he turned against me last 
	night. I still wonder why he would take the side of the Agents over mine. I 
	loved him and trusted him and now I am not so sure I feel the same. All I 
	know is that I feel alone. Carmen and Megan are missing and Josh seems to 
	have turned his back on me. Besides being worried sick, I have a horrible 
	headache and an even nastier bruise on my arm. It must be from when Agent 
	Andrews jammed the needle of, God knows what, into my arm. All my thoughts 
	seem to be random and I find it hard to make sense of them. I feel in a 
	state where I'm not really sure if last night was a dream or a reality. I am 
	hoping this is only a brief side effect of the liquid nightmare forced into 
	me. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I am going to check my emails and take a 
	walk around the facility. I need to gather myself, clear my mind, and figure 
	out what I am going to do.</span></p>
