    Hmmm. I had a bit too much wine. I feel quite light headed. The keyboard 
    seems to have lost some of its stability; some of the keys are pulsating and 
    feel weird to the touch. This was the first day since the operation that I 
    was allowed to drink a considerable amount of alcohol. Alcohol is my 
    greatest enemy but tonight I decided that I couldn’t pass on this 
    opportunity to have some drinks. I can’t remember when wine tasted so good. 
    Maybe it was the combination of good wine and refined food or the nice 
    atmosphere. Or maybe it was the implant in my lobe. It was sweet of Dr. 
    Tachikawa to not order a third bottle of wine, even though the waiter asked 
    if we wanted more.<i> “You’ve had enough for the next three weeks”</i> he 
    spoke fatherly. He was right, I guess. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">For some reason I was 
    having a hard time to keep some moderation. After three glasses my natural 
    reservations have almost completely dissolved. The only thing left was too 
    try and quench my unquenchable thirst. The more I had, the thirstier I 
    became. My cheerful drinking came with some really strange impulses. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Tachikawa had to 
    apologize for me when I tried to turn the salad leaves, which were covered 
    with a most exquisite dressing by the way, into a hair-net. <i>“Salad on 
    your test person”</i> I kept repeating. How was he to know the typical Dutch 
    word play (in Dutch, salad means salad but also to hit)I was clumsily trying 
    to translate into English? Nobody thought it was funny. This evening I was 
    abnormally exuberant, as if I was going on my first school trip. I was so 
    nervous it was irritating, which made me giggle a lot. I was really quite 
    annoyed. Happily Dr. Tachikawa didn’t seem too bothered. Japanese women are 
    also very giggly, so he must be used to it. If he had ordered that third 
    bottle he would have had me in the palm of his hand. I wonder if he realized 
    that. Maybe he didn’t want anything. Possibly he was only concerned with the 
    work. After all, that third bottle would have cost a few more brain cells 
    that are needed for the research. Yes, his research. He hardly speaks of 
    anything else. Will anything else ever be more important than his research?
