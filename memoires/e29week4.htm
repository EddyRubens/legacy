    Kodjiro’s departure was very sudden. He had given us an upload of a Japanese 
    girl celebrating her day of maturity. He received a message on his 
    cell-phone and suddenly threw all equipment into his small suitcase. Then he 
    was gone.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">This time Adrian was 
    much brighter than I was in no time. I still felt like a Japanese in a 
    pleasant way while Adrian started Kodjiro’s desktop computer. This was the 
    first time Dr. Tachikawa left us alone and he took advantage of that moment. 
    In no time he had broken into the most important codes and knew how to enter 
    the internal network.<i> “Come and look here fast!” </i>he called out 
    excited. The whole secret information was rolling over the screen. 
    Explanations about testing chimpanzees. We were focused on three webcams in 
    which we clearly saw visions of large metal wired-cages in which monkeys 
    were getting bored. I didn’t feel comfortable at all seeing so much 
    suffering.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The network also gave 
    us information about Hans and Heather. Something I think it had to do with 
    following-schedules. We read about certain locations where they had been, 
    mentioned with dates and periods. And a report. In that way we discovered 
    that they wanted to avoid any risk concerning the two people on the run. It 
    seemed to be a rather vague text but we could figure out the fact that they 
    were planning to liquidate both of them. Them as well!</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Nervously we were searching a bit further into the computer-files. I 
    wondered what they had written about us. We didn’t find anything. I really 
    don’t know whether that’s good or wrong. While we were searching, a small 
    window opened. It was an urgent call stating time and place. <i>“Urgent. 
    Final call.”</i> Is that why Kodjiro left in a hurry? <i>“Come let’s go,”</i> 
    Adrian said and he shut down the computer.</span></p>
