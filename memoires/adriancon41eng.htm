    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I saw a woman waiting but 
    didn’t recognize her at first. I walked over to her and asked: <i>“Are you 
    Sonja?”.</i> She turned and looked at me. <i>“</i></span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Adrian. 
    Man, you look a mess!”</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial"> 
    I wasn’t feeling too good and I told her I was scared to death. <i>“Some 
    plan here to help us get out of the country!” </i>Sonja told me how it all 
    came about. How she got stuck in all this. A little while later Paul came 
    back with Rosanne. We were ready to go.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">When we 
    arrived at the apartment building I looked up. It was terribly high. <i>“I’m 
    not up for this, but I’ll have to do it.”</i> Paul took the stuff he needed 
    from a locker in the hall and we got into an elevator. There was a strong 
    wind on the roof. I put the parachute pack on my back and secured the straps 
    around my legs as tight as I could. I wanted to be very sure that everything 
    was in place. Rosanne noticed I was scared and said I didn’t have to do 
    this, but I knew better. <i>“We are in this together”</i> was the only thing 
    I could blurt out. And I purposely concealed the fact that I was jumping for 
    Kodjiro’s sake. When all the preparations were made and everything was 
    checked again we walked to the edge of the roof and grabbed Rosanne’s hand. 
    I was scared to death. Paul and Sonja took the elevator back to the ground 
    floor. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">When we 
    saw them standing there I looked at Rosanne (for the last time maybe). We 
    nodded at each other and without saying a word we made the jump. The first 
    pull wasn’t bad, but it just didn’t stop. I kept on falling and wished I 
    hadn’t done it now. I wanted to go back to the safety of the roof. The 
    ground moved towards me at a terrible speed. The wind tore at my limbs and 
    clothes. <i>“This has to stop, I’m falling to my death. The parachute isn’t 
    working. This is the end.”</i></span></p>
