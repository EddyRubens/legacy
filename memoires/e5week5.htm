    These last few days I have relived all sorts of banal memories; the vase, 
    relaxing in the sun, a balloon, being on a swing and yesterday it was eating 
    sushi. In theory the sushi was as banal as the rest, but it had an 
    unexpected and confusing aftertaste. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The test subject from 
    whose memory I recalled clearly loved raw fish. Besides the structure, the 
    smell and of course the flavor of the food, I also experienced a sort of 
    satisfaction. The enjoyment you experience while having your favorite meal. 
    It was mouth watering! That’s saying something for someone who doesn’t like 
    raw fish! This has confused me so much though that I refused to do another 
    session today. Dr. Steward thought that I had more than deserved a break, so 
    I got some free time to saunter through town today. I stopped suddenly at a 
    little Japanese shop. </span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">
    Sushi. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I think I had sushi for the 
    first (and last!) time about six years ago and it’s not a good memory. It 
    was really hard to swallow and I fed most of it to the cat. Even in 
    Greenland I managed to avoid raw fish dishes. Now I suddenly felt an impulse 
    to buy sushi. I guess the satisfaction I got from the imaginary sushi 
    yesterday hasn’t been forgotten. My curiosity was stronger than my confusion 
    and I took a dare. Some rice spilled into my blouse as I tried to eat the 
    sushi as casually as I could. I didn’t get far. After two bites I was 
    gagging and I fed the rest of it to the birds. No more sushi for me, 
    whatever happens. I could have known. </span></p>
