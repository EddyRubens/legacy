    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Last night, after 
    dropping off my apology letter to Sheila's office, I walked over to the 
    communion-room. Carmen seemed a bit depressed and turned down my offer so I 
    was flying solo. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I walked in, I 
    saw two girls talking. I asked if I could sit with them. They seemed 
    hesitant, but gave in, It was like they didn't want me to pick up on their 
    uneasiness. To late for that! They introduced themselves as Sally and Kathy. 
    They seemed to have the same kind of friendship Carmen and I have. Kathy 
    asked if I had any uploads yet. I shared that I had my first one that night. 
    She told me to never let them do the UFO M-Store to me. She said it would 
    mess me up! I smiled and shared the fact that Adrian told me it was one of 
    the better ones! Then she sort of flipped out and yelled <i>&quot;He's in on it 
    too! There all in on it! They're gonna get you, but their NOT going to get 
    me!&quot; </i>My eyes shifted to Sally. She had a shocked look on her face. I 
    just stood up and said, <i>&quot;I think it's time I get going to bed.&quot;</i> I 
    smiled and walked away. But being the nosey ninny that I can be, I hid 
    around behind the door frame to see what Kathy was going to say next. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I heard Sally ask, <i>
    &quot;What's gotten into you?&quot;</i>&nbsp; Kathy said, <i>&quot;I keep telling them that, 'Yes, 
    I would like another M-Store.'&nbsp; But,...I don't.&nbsp; I'm afraid! Sally, I'm so 
    afraid...afraid of what they'll do or say if I refuse them! And, I even know 
    don't know why! There's something strange about this place and I've got to 
    get out of here! I wanna go home!&quot;</i> Sally reassured her that things would 
    be fine. She encouraged Kathy to get more rest. Then I crept away.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">That one seems to have 
    some problems! I wondered if Carmen and I should hook her and Davel up. That 
    would make an interesting couple. Good ol' Captain Peg Leg, sailing the 
    seven seas and Sybil. (You know, Sybil, the schizo girl in that 1970's movie 
    starring Sally Field?) I went and told Carmen. I knew this would get her 
    laughing again! She went on and on about how Kathy could be the wench Davel 
    seemed to be looking for, and she could also be the cook, first mate, cabin 
    boy and a lookout. <i>&quot;Who knows, she might have enough personalities for 
    each!&quot;</i> Carmen said.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen seemed to be in 
    a better mood. I though it was because I cheered her up with the Davel-Kathy 
    story. Turns out that Sheila came by while I was gone and told her that she 
    would get her first upload tomorrow. Thank God!&nbsp; I was happy and relieved at 
    the same time. I can't stand seeing Carmen depressed! She was asking all 
    kinda of questions about what they did to me. I told her everything that 
    happened, again. This time she was obviously interested. She asked if I 
    would go stand in the room with her. I told her I would, if they let me.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It's funny how the one 
    person you think is so tough and so together, is so dependent. I don't mind, 
    honestly! It's nice to know that she wants me around, not just tolerates my 
    presence! We'll have to see what Dr. Hamilton says </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">tomorrow! I wonder what 
    she will experience. Will she get the jets too?</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">
