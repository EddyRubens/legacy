    <span style="font-family: Arial">Well, a day has passed since my last entry. 
    I have done three days of various testing. All of it was very strenuous to 
    the mind. Some made sense, but what is up with that room with the colors and 
    shapes? I felt like I was in Kindergarten. The one I found most interesting 
    was the test where I was blindfolded and had to guess what things were by 
    using my other senses. It reminded me of one of those games you play at a 
    slumber party. There were lots of other tests, but the one I liked least was 
    the physical test, it was grueling!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Sheila stopped by my room last night and 
    said I could sleep in a bit if I wanted. Apparently Dr. Hamilton was going 
    to review my tests and decide if I will work out. I sure would like to meet 
    Dr. Tachikawa. I wonder why he is in Japan so much when the facility is here? 
    I guess business is business no matter where you are!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen was accepted as a test subject 
    yesterday. She is very excited and I am happy for her. She has the choice of 
    getting either of the two implants. She has not decided which one she wants, 
    but she had until tomorrow to make her choice. I am going to miss her when 
    she is moved to the 'Left Wing.' She will go in two days. I am unsure how 
    long she will be there. I guess however long it takes to recover. She told 
    me that after she gets her implant she has a choice as to whether or not she 
    wants her own room. She asked me if I am accepted as a test subject, would I 
    be her roommate still? She said she doesn't really know anyone else to well, 
    and would just feel more comfortable. I said yes, of course!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen and I took advantage of the time 
    this morning by writing emails to our guys. We get along great. I suppose 
    the fact that both of us leaving it all back home to try something exciting 
    has left us feeling alone and in need of a good friend. Instantly we have 
    become like two peas in a pod. She has started telling people we were twins 
    separated at birth, even though we look nothing alike. She told me when this 
    is all over, her and Diego were thinking about finding a house in a nice, 
    quiet area. I told her there were a few houses in my area and I could have 
    Josh get info on them. I was suprised when she said she was interested! I 
    already lost my best friend Carrie to Germany, I don't think I could stand 
    to lose another one to New Jersey.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">After our sending our emails and getting 
    dolled up, we went into town. While we were walking around, this guy from 
    Braintec, Davel was walking towards us. Carmen told me not to talk to him 
    because he was strange. After he walked by us I asked how she knew him. She 
    told me that he stopped her in the hall the other day and told her he was a 
    pirate who just anchored his ship. He said he took seven prisoners because 
    they were laughing at his wooden leg. He continued saying he was looking for 
    a wench to feed his mind and other hungers. Carmen said she thought he was 
    playing a joke on her at first, but then it was like he snapped out of it 
    and in a completely normal voice he asked her what she wanted, like she had 
    stopped him for something. I was laughing at the time when she told me but 
    now I am worried that maybe they messed up on him. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">I hate to admit that I am having second 
    thoughts now. I would like to tell Josh, but I know he would tell me to just 
    come home. This is something I am going to have to really think about, 
    especially since I find out tomorrow if they want me as a test subject.</span></p>
