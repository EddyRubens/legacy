    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Dr. 
    Tachikawa has spoken to me for a long time about the benefits of the M-Store, 
    but no matter how much I hint and ask, he resumes revealing information 
    about the methods of memory storage. If I could only find out how that works... 
    and use it for my daily job.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I also 
    want to know if it is possible to alter the captured memories, if some sort 
    of ‘pollution’ is possible, through which a contamination might exist. That 
    could explain why everybody ‘sees’ or experiences different things. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I decide 
    to create a false experience with the help of self-hypnoses. One that has to 
    reveal clearly if there are influences from outside or they are altered by 
    the test subjects themselves. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">After 
    some considerations I made a waterproof plan. Now I only have to wait for my 
    up-load.... and then we will see how the test subjects shall recognize the 
    money they’ll find... it is an automatism to think in your own currency, 
    even 14 months after the introduction of the Euro in Europe more than 70 
    percent of the people still thinks in their old currency. So a huge pack of 
    blank banknotes in a backpack will get some colour.... </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I am 
    very anxious what the meeting organised by Prof K. Tachikawa will be about.... 
    seems very urgent and in our conversation this morning during breakfast. Not 
    the least hint... Wonder how Rosanne feels, she is so tense lately anyway. 
    And in between I have to go for the up-load... will I be able to concentrate 
    enough to do my little trick????</span></p>

    through the long corricor I bump into Davel... No I do not know what this 
    meeting is all about. I leave him standing and continue... excitement in the
