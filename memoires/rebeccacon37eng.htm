    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I got back to my 
    room, Carmen was sitting on my bed eating one of the Chocolate Monkeys. She 
    said she feels a little better getting things off her chest and knowing she 
    has a friend on her side. I plopped down on the bed beside her, grabbed one 
    of the monkeys for myself and told her I would find a way to get her through 
    this. She grabbed the Chocolate Monkey out of my hand before I could take a 
    bite and said, <i>&quot;Hey Chocolate is the cure for sadness, So I have to eat 
    one Monkey day, So I can get some gladness!&quot;</i> We both started laughing! &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I told her that we 
    should get something to eat and try to figure out a plan. She said just 
    thinking about all of this makes her lose her appetite. I told her that I 
    was going to get us some White Rice and Lemon Chicken from the Chinese 
    delivery. She agreed that that sounded good, so I called in an order. Carmen 
    wanted to take a short nap, so I decided to wait by the front door for our 
    order to arrive. While walking to the chairs in the front of the building, I 
    over heard two guys talking about Davel. They were laughing. One of them 
    said, <i>&quot;He always does crazy stuff like that! He's the Egor of Braintec.&quot;</i>&nbsp; 
    I asked him what happened with Davel. He said that around 2:00 today, he 
    attacked two female test subjects. He slapped and pushed over an older lady 
    wearing a black dress, calling her a witch, then grabbed the younger girl 
    and shook her repeatedly speaking some gibberish. <i>&quot;I guess Davel was 
    trying to do some reverse spell because he thought she was a 'gray and hairy 
    monster,'&quot; </i>one of the guys told me. <i>&quot;She was wearing a gray cashmere 
    sweater and he ripped it off her saying, 'Let the monster be gone!' It took 
    three security nurses to hold him down!&quot; </i>I just said, <i>&quot;That's 
    terrible!&quot; </i>and walked away. I can't help but feel responsible for that! 
    Everyone in this place has gone crazy! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I waited for the food 
    and went back to my room. I told Carmen about what happened. It didn't seem 
    so funny to laugh at him anymore! They really did mess up on him! Carmen sat 
    on her bed and ate while I checked my emails. One from my sweetness, Josh; 
    One from Megan; and one from the Central Intelligence Agency. (CIA) </span>
