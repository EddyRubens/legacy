    <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-weight: 700">I could not help 
    laughing very loud when I realized that I openly admitted to the impulse to 
    attend keep-fit exercises. Standing beside my bed I was stretching and 
    bending. Actually it felt good. I think I must have been twelve when I 
    attended such exercises last.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">My parents had a voluminous medical 
    encyclopedia which I had gone through now and again. Diseases and illnesses 
    with illustrative photos attached to it. At the end of the book some twenty 
    exercises with drawings how to keep healthy and fit. By bending the spinal 
    column I could avoid getting the most horrible skin-diseases, open wounds on 
    legs and other awful disorders. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">Why was I again fascinated in making so 
    much effort with my body? For a long time I have not seen disgusting 
    pictures and meanwhile I do not believe anymore in the protective power of 
    all those exercises. Surprisingly I choose low-fat cheese for breakfast. 
    What is wrong with me? Why did I go for the healthy way? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-weight: 700">The pounding of my 
    heart skipped a few times when I saw that Kathy was dealing with the same 
    healthy-maniac-method. As long as I know her she takes four spoonfuls of 
    sugar into her tea. Now she drank without! She got a bit frightened when I 
    told her that. She had almost emptied her glass but when hearing my remark 
    she suddenly realized she had forgotten to take sugar. <i>“Oh well, I also 
    like it this way,”</i> she discovered in a calm way. You could see she did 
    not agree at all. Frightened and scared she looked at me. It would be wiser 
    not to mention anything about it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">I asked Kathy if she had more uploads 
    after my UFO-experience. She got excited when she told me that she saw 
    Adelle’s niece on stage yesterday. The quality of this upload also took her 
    by surprise. Actually I wanted to know if she knew anything about the 
    miscarriages but I did not dare asking her. It would be wrong. If I were 
    Adelle I wouldn’t like anybody to know about it. We were chatting about 
    details of Helen’s dress and so on, until Kathy left for her appointment. I 
    decided to pay a visit to Adrian. Maybe he could make use of my help. 
    Yesterday it appeared he had a brainwave when he tried to explain how his 
    DOSS-system works. But I couldn’t let go the fact that both Kathy and I are 
    worrying about our diet. Especially after we experienced Adelle’s memory 
    again!&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
