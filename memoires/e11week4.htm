    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    probably entered the common office at the wrong moment, ‘coss Steward 
    suddenly stopped talking. He waited till I had picked up all the dossiers I 
    needed and then continued talking in a subdued voice. His mysterious silence 
    arouse my curiosity, even more so ‘coss he was only speaking to Dr. 
    Tachikawa. I had to eavesdrop on this conversation through the closed door.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">My curiosity controlled 
    me totally. Steward almost whispered, and therefore I had to push my ear 
    against the door till it turned red. &nbsp;<i>“Don’t you think it’s odd? I would 
    feel passed over if I stood in your shoes. You are in to this together, 
    aren’t you?”</i> What was Steward talking about? For one moment I had this 
    scary feeling that he was talking about Dr. Tachikawa and me. How did I pass 
    him and what exactly are we into together? <i>“If I were you, I would 
    explain the ins and outs of the matter very clearly to him. He is nowhere 
    without you.”</i> I could hardly hear what Steward said after that. 
    Something about his mind or being blind. I tried to hear more through the 
    keyhole. That wasn’t such a good idea. The door flew wide open and hit me 
    full on my temple. Dr. Tachikawa walked away angrily. He turned once, to see 
    me, and I think I could read some wonder off his face beside the anger. Then 
    he continued walking. The whole left side of my face hurt. But especially 
    the part right next to my eye. It felt warm and thick and it pumped as if my 
    hart had moved to there. Steward entered the corridor as well. He asked me 
    in an annoyed way if I had listened in. When he saw how I leaned against the 
    wall, he became milder. <i>“What is wrong with you?”</i> I murmured that I 
    missed one dossier and that the door had hit my face. <i>“What a prick.”</i> 
    Steward said grumpily. Did he mean me or Dr. Tachikawa?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><b>Because the door had 
    seriously hit the left side of my face - I almost had a black eye – Steward 
    wanted to make an MRI-scan. So I had to enter that claustrophobic tube again. 
    Fortunately everything was still intact. My face looks like I have been in a 
    fight and I have already been asked several times what I had done with it.
    <i>“Walked into a door.”</i> is the classical answer. I don’t worry about 
    this injury and now that he knows that the MESI isn’t damaged, Steward doesn’t 
    either. What does go on in my mind, are the words that made Dr. Tachikawa so 
    angry. What was Steward talking about? It wasn’t about Dr. Tachikawa and me, 
    ‘coss he mentioned a he.</b> &nbsp;</span></p>
