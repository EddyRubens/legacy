    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">No extractions today, no 
    uploads, nothing at all. <i>“Nothing to do today, how boring.”</i> I thought 
    when I woke up at half past ten. But the weather was nice. I immediately 
    remembered the lowest drawer of my closet and the smelly socks and what was 
    lying behind that. A whole world is waiting for me. The decision was already 
    made. I am going to have a nibble from the forbidden fruits; called 
    M-stores. I made a plan. This afternoon I would drive to the forest and 
    there, at a nice quiet spot, I would take an upload. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">First I 
    had to install the portable uploader correctly. Because there is always 
    someone present at an upload, to operate the equipment. Now I had to 
    configure it this way that it would switch off</span><span style="font-family: Arial">
    </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">automatically after an 
    upload. And I had to reload the batteries. Imagine me there in the middle of 
    nowhere suddenly without electricity. I scrabbled in the box and took three 
    M-stores out. Faith would decide which one I would take. I was ready to go. 
    After thirty minutes driving I entered a woody place. I turned when I saw a 
    small side-path. The small path ended at some water. That seemed to be an 
    appropriate place. I got out and took the equipment. When everything was 
    connected I started the upload. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><i>I was inside 
    a tropical forest. Some kind of jungle. I was sitting on a branch in a tree 
    and looked around. I saw a lot of chimpanzees. There was one my lap, a 
    little one. When I looked done, behind the small monkey, I saw my hands and 
    knees. I was a monkey myself. The little one grasped itself tightly on me 
    with its hands and feet and together we swung through the branches, 
    searching for food. We found a branch with berries and we tuck into it.</i>

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Then it was 
    over. A short, but very special upload. Kodjiro had sent me something 
    beautiful. So he did experiments with animals as well. I didn’t know that. 
    That was funny. Suddenly getting a memory from an animal! Who could have 
    thought about that. I couldn’t. I was sitting there totally surprised and 
    relish the athletic jumps across the crowns of the trees.</span></p>
