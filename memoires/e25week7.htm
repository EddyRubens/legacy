    Kodjiro had to organize a few things. That gave me a chance to collect my 
    rucksack. He gave me a key of his apartment and a pile of banknotes. I didn’t 
    have to worry about money, not anymore.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was whistling 
    through the streets. I felt fantastic. A sunny day and I just had a 
    fantastic upload. A bit strange, though. I wondered if the couple really 
    made love or I if was imagining things. Maybe it was my own dirty mind. And 
    that Yuki, is she real? Many women out here resemble her. While I was 
    waiting for the green light, I looked at one of them. Oh, how pretty she 
    was! No Yuki but she looked just as smart. Again I felt that loving feeling 
    in my tummy. I felt like a stud! The woman looked directly into my eyes. My 
    pheromones were heading in all sorts of directions. I sweetly smiled at her, 
    which got her frightened a bit. She turned her face again and crossed the 
    street. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">How 
    wild can you get when you experience somebody else’s memories? My identity 
    seems to get less important. I live from experience to experience and 
    meanwhile I go through very weird situations. The world is shocking. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Wearing my rucksack on 
    my back I slowly approached Kodjiro’s apartment. It was heavy. Again I 
    started thinking of Davel. I wished I had his muscles now. Do I miss him? I 
    feel sorry I didn’t say goodbye to him. I had to leave in a hurry. When I 
    arrived ‘home’ I connected my laptop. Let’s see if I received any email. 
    Some test subjects reacted to my farewell-email. Good. Adelle emailed that 
    she understood very well but she rejected my developments. It is obvious on 
    which side she is now. She wrote about a new project, Braintec is dealing 
    with this week. In exchange for financial support of Defense, they register 
    the good memories of soldiers in training. If these soldiers would get 
    traumatized by violence of war they can rely on their own memories. Sort of 
    sperm-bank for memories. I had a strange e-mail about chimpanzees, Braintec 
    is testing at the moment. Many developments in which I do not participate 
    anymore. I feels good not being involved in that institution. Never ever 
    wearing that stupid suit with those high heels. It doesn’t suit me. I feel 
    more freedom now.</span></p>
