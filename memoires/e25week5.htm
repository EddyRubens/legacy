    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    didn’t make sense traveling to the Virgin again, for checking my email. Much 
    better to head for the Braintec-building right away. Quickly I ate a 
    noodle-dish and went to the metro station, the one the doctor mentioned to 
    me. I walked in circles for more than one hour in that neighborhood until I 
    gave up searching. I walked towards a taxi parked in the street and showed 
    my note to a taxi-driver. He also didn’t understand. Out here it’s very 
    difficult. Streets have no names, but numbers. A completely different system 
    to ours. I don’t understand it at all. My heart sank into my boots, when 
    suddenly the driver was pointing at a huge white building. <i>“Five,”</i> he 
    said and showed me all his fingers on his hand. <i>“Five!”</i> he repeated 
    another time and I thanked him politely. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Number five? Insecure 
    I entered the doorway and took the elevator up. At the fifth floor I got 
    out. It rather looked like a restaurant or a cocktail-bar. ‘Coss I didn’t 
    discover any other possibilities, I entered the place. An old woman was 
    cleaning the floor. She didn’t speak English. How irritating, I still cannot 
    understand Japanese language. I was seated at a low table, completely lost. 
    I never understand how to sit down on those cushions. I tried to slide my 
    legs under me, as elegant as possible. Suddenly he sat there. I didn’t hear 
    him coming. When he found out that I got scared, he nodded friendly. I bent 
    forward and gave him the small paper. Again no English. The man was looking 
    at the street-map and then again at me. After that he yelled something at 
    the cleaning woman. She nodded and walked to the back as fast as she could. 
    A little later she returned with tea, pouring it for us elegantly. To 
    interrupt the silence I mentioned Kodjiro. His eyes opened up. <i>
    “Tachikawa? Kodjiro Tachikawa?”</i> he asked thoroughly. I nodded happily. 
    Finally somebody who knew what I was talking about. He took out his 
    telephone from his pocket, surrounded by about four or five small animals 
    hanging on to it, and started calling. Then he said something to the woman. 
    Whom did he call? I got frightened. What the hell is going on?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    old woman gave us a bowl of rice and a dish with snacks. What a pity I do 
    not like raw fish. I managed to eat some, just being polite. A few seconds 
    later she returned with a bowl of beans. They were delicious. I tried not to 
    think about a bill that might be offered soon. All together I joined that 
    man at the table for more than an hour. I wasn’t keen on the uncomfortable 
    situation. Once in a while we laughed at each other. I really regret I 
    couldn’t communicate with him at all. Then he entered. Dressed in a long 
    black coat Kodjiro walked into the room. I think I never felt so happy 
    before, seeing him. Finally!</span></p>
