	<span style="font-family:Arial">Thomas invited me to stay for a little 
	longer, just as friends. He said he didn't really have anyone to talk to and 
	he just wanted to share this really strange upload with me. After making 
	such a fool of myself, I felt a little obligated to stay. I loved being in 
	Thomas' company I just wanted to hurry and see Carmen.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Thomas started off by telling me that this 
	was his second upload. He said the first one was an amazing experience, 
	surfing in Hawaii. <i>&quot;Bu this one was really different,&quot; </i>he said.&nbsp;<i> 
	&quot;It's kinda embarrassing so you better promise not to laugh.&quot; &quot;I promise.&quot;</i> 
	I said</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial"><i>&quot;OK,&quot;</i> he continued. <i>&quot;At first I 
	remember feeling like I was in this warm, dark and safe place. There were a 
	lot of voices, but they were muffled. I could hear one voice better than the 
	others. It was a woman's voice. It was actually more of a vibration. Then, 
	all of sudden I started hearing these gurgling sounds and I felt a lot of 
	pressure. It was like I was being forced to move. There was lots of pressure 
	on my head, at first, then it was gone. It was very bright and I felt 
	confused. The next thing I remember was my arms and shoulders coming free. 
	Next my legs were revealed and I felt really cold and scared. I was wrapped 
	up in a blanket and put in a little incubator. That's all I remember. Weird, 
	huh!&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Of course I was thinking the worst the 
	entire time Thomas was explaining is upload. It was obviously a M-Store of 
	being born. Surely, there were no other pregnant women in this facility with 
	unborn MESI implanted babies. Had Dr. Hamilton gone and done an extraction 
	on Carmen's baby causing a premature birth? </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial"><i>&quot;Thomas,&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;I really have 
	to go now. I am worried about my friend. She is being kept in the 'Left 
	Wing' and I have to try to find a way to get in there.&quot; &quot;Left Wing?&quot; </i>he 
	said. <i>&quot;Girl, you should have mentioned something earlier. I can get you 
	into the 'Left Wing.' But it's too late tonight. They'll know something is 
	up if I take you in there tonight! You wanna go tomorrow?&quot; </i>I felt tears 
	welling in my eyes,<i>&quot;Oh, Thomas&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;Thank you so much. I owe 
	you one. I'll be here first thing tomorrow morning. And, I'm so sorry about 
	earlier!&quot; &quot;Sorry?&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;What are you sorry for? I should be 
	thanking you!&quot;</i> </span>
