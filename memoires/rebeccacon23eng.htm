    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I waited in the hall 
    while Sheila was getting Carmen ready for her upload. While looking at some 
    framed photos on the wall I saw something out of the corner of my eye. One 
    of the other Braintec assistants was pushing a stretcher down the hall where 
    Carmen and I heard the scream. I quietly hurried back down the hall to see 
    if I could catch a glimpse of who was on the stretcher. I gasped when I saw 
    that it was Kathy, the girl I met in the communion-room. She was already 
    freaking out last night. She must have really went over the edge today! If I 
    see Sally I might ask her what happened. I already know Sheila won't share 
    anything with me.&nbsp;</span></p>

    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I hurried back to 
    where Carmen's door was. If Sheila saw me snooping I might get a lecture 
    about; <i>&quot;How it's not OK to want to know everyone else's business.&quot;</i> 
    And; <i>&quot;How would I feel if others were interfering in my business.&quot;</i> I 
    swear, that woman needs to get a life, or a man!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Sheila came out a few 
    minutes later and asked if I was ready to go to her office. I figured I 
    would talk long enough to give Carmen the chance to talk to Dr. Hamilton, 
    then end the conversation. When we reached her office she said that she was 
    glad I offered to talk. We went inside and that's when she told me she 
    appreciated the letter I wrote and thought it showed a lot of class. I told 
    her I was having a bad day, like I had mentioned in the letter, and I had a 
    lot on my mind. She asked how I was feeling about having the uploads and was 
    there anything I wanted to share with her. I told her I thought it might 
    take too long if I started talking now and maybe we could postpone this 
    conversation to another time. She agreed and thanked me for my time. Then we 
    headed back to where Carmen was. I have to admit, our conversation wasn't as 
    bad as I thought it was going to be. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When we got back to 
    where Carmen was, the door was closed with a sign hanging on a hook reading,
    <i>&quot;Upload in progress Do not disturb!&quot;</i> Sheila went inside quietly and I 
    was left alone in the hall. I guess Dr. Hamilton refused Carmen's request. I 
    hope everything goes okay for her. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I am now sitting in 
    our room waiting for Carmen. I can't wait to hear about her upload. Honestly, 
    I can't wait for another one myself! I have to go for now, someone is 
    knocking at my door.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial"> </span>
