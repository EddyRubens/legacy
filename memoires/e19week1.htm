    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Today an urgent 
    meeting was held which lasted almost the whole day. For this morning Dr. 
    Hamilton has had a brief but clear discussion with the National Institute of 
    Mental Health, our main sponsor. Through the media they were informed about 
    the improved techniques. The interpretation of the press was absolutely not 
    tolerated by them. The Institute refuses to invest money in public 
    entertainment and underlined the conditions in which finance is supporting 
    this project. If we cannot deal with that they will stop the flow of money 
    as from today. Before the end of this week they expect us to give them an 
    explanation with respect to these improvements.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was not that easy. 
    Meetings going on the whole day. Without the financial support of this 
    institution we can shut down the whole matter. Then we won’t be able to pay 
    the rent of this building. So we have to meet with their demands whether we 
    like it or not. Dr. Hamilton never intended to change ideas on the original 
    plans. But Dr. Tachikawa is facing him now right at this moment. <i>“Future 
    can be found in entertainment, not in medical complaint!”</i> he shouted 
    when state of mind was getting out of hand. And I truly believed that 
    Japanese never showed any of their feelings. If you would ask me, I think 
    Kodjiro has become the same hothead as I.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I never saw Dr. 
    Hamilton that furious and especially now he admitted the whole matter much 
    better, but all the same he managed to temper his anger very well. I felt 
    sorry for him. If Braintec had to realize somebody’s dream, it would be his 
    one. He would rather prefer to develop a new medical method for Alzheimer’s 
    disease or dementia. Not to become famous or just for the sake of money, but 
    the merciful side of the medical world: to recover the sick. Dr. Hamilton is 
    a born starry-eyed idealist. And now he sees with his own eyes that Dr. 
    Tachikawa is heading a different direction. Just the one and only direction 
    in front of him. That is really hard on him. And even more difficult to find 
    a good solution for it. Dr. Tachikawa is definitely not interested in 
    changing his intentions. He also has a dream to come true. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“But without the 
    financial support of the National Institute you also cannot develop your own 
    inventions!”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> Dr. Hamilton 
    suggested in a diplomatic way. <i>“Or were your intentions to approach Sony 
    just like that?”</i> Also Dr. Tachikawa was not touched by this remark and 
    it kept on going like this. This meeting was such a very exhausted one. 
    Nobody got any wiser. That explanation for the institution will definitely 
    break through. On paper Dr. Tachikawa’s ideas will be not as interesting and 
    even eliminated. But in reality his brightness will never go away. 
    Inspirations all over the place. Nobody can stop Dr. Tachikawa anymore.</span></b></p>
