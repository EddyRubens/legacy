    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    doesn’t work out anymore. Now that I’ve been here too long I cannot behave 
    as a tourist anymore. Acting as if I were Japanese is impossible. Their 
    habits are incredible and it doesn’t strike me. I cannot be myself here any 
    longer.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Now that I have stayed 
    here a bit longer, I realize how complicated people can be. What I 
    experienced first as friendly but standoffish, became much more complicated 
    now. I really don’t understand. When to face people while at certain moments 
    it’s very impolite, when and in particular how deep I have to bow forwards, 
    which gestures I have to refuse out of respect and which manners are 
    absolutely not done. It’s hard on me. It seems impossible for me to adjust.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">No wonder I cannot 
    understand Kodjiro. He may have experienced half of his career abroad; 
    Japanese customs are not new to him. And now that he is ’back home’ again, 
    he behaves like a Japanese more than ever. His strange reactions, his 
    silence for hours and all his other incredible behavior obviously has a 
    meaning. There’s something I will never ever understand. Why they just 
    cannot say what they think or what they want? Why they have to act in such a 
    mysterious way?&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Maybe I misuse his 
    hospitality. For a couple of weeks I have been staying in his apartment and 
    I behave like I’m living here. According to Japanese ideas there is much 
    room here, but according to space it looks more like a student’s place. Now 
    and then we stand in the way. We constantly argue and sometimes tension has 
    gotten so badly that for a few times I had been considering flying back to 
    Portland right away. A couple of times I suggested to talk about this, but 
    Kodjiro don’t want me to leave and he doesn’t want to speak about it either. 
    Who is he to decide about me? It won’t work anymore. Wished we could simply 
    talk about it! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">It has become my habit 
    loafing about the streets in town. Just killing time. Usually I walk about 
    completely lost. It doesn’t matter to me anymore how much electronics are 
    sold in Akihabara. And all those exceptional modern and female shoes in town, 
    never for sale in my size, can’t grab me either. Is this being homesick?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Walking through town is just a poor excuse. Actually I was hoping Sonja 
    would drag me again into this alley. And then spending much time and fun 
    together. For that reason I often walk about the district where I had given 
    my blood and where this strange meeting was held. I have given the city-map 
    to Sonja. Maybe I’ll meet her here soon.</span></p>
