	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I returned to my room, everything that 
	belonged to Carmen was gone. I couldn't believe how fast they did things 
	here. When they wanted someone to disappear, they did it and they did it 
	well. As I stood staring at her empty half of the room, I felt a hollowness 
	in the bottom of my stomach. Even though I knew that she was OK, this was 
	like a final notice they acted upon in order to let me know that I wouldn't 
	be seeing her anymore. That's only what they thought!</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I only had a short time before someone would 
	come looking for me since I was due for an upload. I went into the bathroom 
	to hide the 'Left Wing' pass and the photo copies I took of the baby files. 
	I pulled out the Band-Aid box from inside the medicine cabinet. I pulled out 
	some of the Band-Aids and shoved in the pass and the folded up photo copies. 
	Then, I put all the Band-Aids back in the box. I was proud of the hiding 
	spot I found. I cleaned off the make-up from my face with cotton and 
	astringent, and flushed it down the toilet when I was done. I brushed my 
	hair into a ponytail and walked out of the bathroom. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I was shocked and startled to see Sheila 
	sitting on Carmen's barren bed. Good thing I flushed the toilet. No telling 
	how long she was in my room. If I were to just walk out, she might start to 
	wonder what I was doing in there that whole time. If she was here for the 
	pass or the copies, I wouldn't want her to get any ideas as to where my 
	hiding place was. I could tell she knew something was going on, and she was 
	here to confront me. <i>&quot;Rebecca...&quot; </i>She said. She paused for a minute 
	and looked down at her feet, as though she was trying to find a specific way 
	to say something. <i>&quot;I understand that you probably have a lot of questions 
	that need to be answered...so I spoke with Dr. Hamilton....He agreed that 
	this would be a good time for you and I to sit down and discuss all your...well,...present 
	issues.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Because she paused so many time in so few 
	sentences, I wasn't sure if that was the end of her opening speech. So, I 
	waited for a minute without saying anything. It wasn't until she raised her 
	eyebrows at me with that knew she was waiting for me to respond. <i>&quot;I'm not 
	quite sure what your getting at Sheila.&quot;</i> I said to her. I could tell by 
	the look on her face that she was disappointed that I didn't sit down and 
	spill the proverbial pot of beans. Now she had to come up with a way of 
	asking for the information she wanted. <i>&quot;Well,&quot;</i> She began. <i>&quot;I 
	suppose I thought you might be wondering what happen to your friend Carmen, 
	for one. You have noticed all her belongings were gone, haven't you?&quot;<br>
	&quot;Yes, I noticed.&quot;</i> I replied. <i>&quot;Did you take them?&quot;<br>
	&quot;Oh, heavens no.&quot;</i> Sheila quickly answered. She continued with some crazy 
	story about Carmen. Her explanation for Carmen's recent absence was 
	supposedly due to a 'ruptured ovarian cyst.' She said since Carmen and I 
	were both found in the wrecked car with Carmen in the driver seat, it was 
	assumed that her 'abnormally large cyst' must have ruptured while she was 
	driving. <i>&quot;The pain must have been so horribly excruating that she lost 
	control of the car.&quot; </i>She explained. <i>&quot;You must have blacked out...then 
	blocked all memory of it.&quot; </i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I stood there looking at her. <i>&quot;Um...yea...&quot;
	</i>was all I managed to mutter. Poor Sheila. She was a horrible actress. So 
	dramatic. Too dramatic. <i>&quot;Well,&quot;</i> She added, <i>&quot;Carmen was rushed to 
	another emergency care facility that Braintec is affiliated with. She is 
	recovering well from the minor surgery that she had there. Dr. Hamilton 
	informed me that she has called him and requested for her MESI to be removed. 
	She will have the procedure tonight and will be going home when she has 
	fully recovered.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">That was it. That was the best excuse they 
	could come up with. I told Sheila That I needed some time to absorb all the 
	information she had just shared. She acted concerned. I decided to play her 
	little game and told her that I would find her if I needed to talk. I went 
	over to the door and opened it. It was my polite way of asking her to leave. 
	She got the hint and stood up and headed for the door. Before she left she 
	turned to me and asked, <i>&quot;Is there anything else bothering you?...Or...Is 
	there anything you might,...I don't know... want to get off your chest? <br>
	</i>I looked to the right for a second, frowned, and acted like I was 
	thinking. Then I said, <i>&quot;No, nothing I can think of.&quot;<br>
	&quot;OK,&quot;</i> She said, <i>&quot;You know where to find me.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Once she left and headed down the hall a 
	bit, I stuck my head out the door and called her name. Sheila turned around 
	and faced me saying, <i>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
	&quot;Carmen and I are best friends...&quot; </i>I said. <i>&quot;Yes,.....&quot;</i> she said 
	again, only in a different tone. <i>&quot;Just seem funny...you know...that she 
	never called me!&quot;</i> I said. Sheila got a real funny look on her face and I 
	went back into my room. I couldn't let her have the last word on this one! I 
	only hope I didn't screw things up for Carmen. I need to get hold of Kaleb 
	and see when that other Agent will be coming for us.</span></p>
