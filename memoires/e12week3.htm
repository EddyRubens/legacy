    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    uploads and extractions are almost becoming routine. I still get a kick out 
    of them, but they don’t surprise me as much. The memories are all different 
    of course. Sometimes I’m so impressed by a particular memory that I find it 
    hard to think about anything else for the rest of the day. I had one of 
    those intense uploads about ten days ago. I miss those when I’m not getting 
    them. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It’s become the same 
    tedious routine for the team, apparently. Everybody was waiting with great 
    disinterest until Steward had selected an M-store. He was scrolling through 
    the files, looking for a memory I hadn’t relived yet. There were a few and 
    he named them; a boat trip, another birthday and somebody’s dog. <i>“Can I 
    have the amusement park memory again?”</i> I asked, surprising myself. I 
    didn’t think the memories Steward mentioned would be as exciting as the 
    amusement park one. Steward turned to me and said: <i>“No, you can’t. We 
    don’t upload the same memory twice.” “Why not?“</i> I shot back. <i>“You can 
    watch a movie more than once. You can read a book again.” “Yes,”</i> Dr. 
    Hamilton agreed, <i>“but you’re forgetting something very fundamental. We’re 
    not doing this research to entertain our test subjects. This is a serious, 
    solid research program where the usefulness of the results are more 
    important than the pleasure the test subjects get out of it.“</i> He sounded 
    slightly irritated. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Strangely enough I 
    felt irritated as well. It was an impulsive suggestion, but now I wanted 
    nothing rather than to saunter through that dream world. I started to whine 
    like a little kid. <i>“Aren’t you curious what effect it might have? When 
    you see a movie for the second time, you experience other things too. Surely 
    that must be interesting?”</i> Dr. Tachikawa became restless. But he kept 
    quiet. <i>“Sure it won’t do any harm.”</i> Steward said and I felt grateful 
    to him for the first time. <i>“Even if we can’t use the results, we have 
    nothing to lose.”</i> Dr. Hamilton appeared to be buried in his thoughts. 
    Say yes, say yes, say yes, I wished to myself. Only thinking about this 
    memory had already turned me into a child! Dr. Hamilton looked at Dr. 
    Tachikawa, who was staring into the distance, expressionless. Then Dr. 
    Hamilton gave in: <i>“Do what you want. I’ll read the reports later.”</i>&nbsp; 
    To everyone’s amazement he just walked away. Dr. Hamilton was always there 
    when I got an upload and I much appreciated his presence. He’s a good guy 
    and the fact that he’s always so serious makes the procedure really 
    trustworthy. Dr. Tachikawa shrugged. <i>“We can do it without him.”</i> he 
    mumbled. He was right of course. The procedure had become so routine that 
    one person could deal with it without any problems. </span></p>
