    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I never 
    thought that I would return to Portland with so much pleasure. Everybody was 
    there. Even Steve and Robbert had come over. Adelle acted as master of 
    ceremonies. She organised everything to the last detail and was dreadfully 
    busy getting it all done. When she saw me she ran towards me. <i>“I’m so 
    glad that you’re all back again.”</i> She said. We had little time for 
    talking, because she was so busy. Her black eye had healed up, thankfully, 
    or she had covered it well. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">It was a 
    really great party, but it also felt like a goodbye party. I had to get out 
    every now and then, to wander aimlessly through the halls of the Braintec 
    building. It was there that I walked into Rosanne. She was, like me, saying 
    goodbye to everything that connected her to this place. <i>“Tomorrow 
    everything will be different. And next month it will all be a memory.”</i>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial">I said. </span>
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Rosanne looked at me and then 
    we just started laughing. She’s getting an operation to remove the implant 
    tomorrow. I decided to have the operating done by my surgeon friend in 
    Elgin. Hamilton has given me a map with instructions for him, so nothing can 
    go wrong in the hospital in Scotland. But maybe I will just leave it in. As 
    a sort of souvenir. </span></p>
