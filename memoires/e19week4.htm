    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">If I 
    want to, I could skip everything between my fingers. No responsibilities 
    anymore, no connection with anything happening around me. Surely the world 
    will go on without me. Hardly anybody will notice it when I’m not there 
    anymore. Only thing I have to do is to let loose. I’m absolutely not 
    suicidal, getting rid of this all has nothing to do with dying. If dying is 
    the issue here, then I’m already in paradise for quite a while.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I don’t wanna die. I 
    simply don’t want this life. It’s too much for me. Deciding on all those 
    choices, time and again. I am dealing with it all by myself. I want to prove 
    that I can manage to be somebody. I want to be loved and I want to love 
    somebody myself too. It takes too much energy and time for me. I cannot 
    control it anymore. Enough is enough. I could lay down a bit, right here now, 
    and relax, and let it slip away. Try and keep all worries, all tension. 
    Won’t be needed anymore. I give up. Let the good times roll. I don’t care 
    who I am or what I am. I have been so uncertain lately that I hardly 
    recognize myself anymore. One moment I am a bad witch, the other a femme 
    fatale, telling lies obsessively and the next time I’m a scared girl needing 
    love so desperately. They take over from me. Together they choose the 
    easiest way out. Choose the line of least resistance. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Then those voices 
    reappear. Whenever I loose control of the grip, I immediately hear the 
    buzzing. I’m not so much afraid anymore than before. Let them do the talking. 
    Now and again I can hear bits and pieces of conversations. There is somebody 
    who has wrong intentions. A troublemaker. He tells me not to accept anything 
    anymore and that I have been mislead more than enough. I do am afraid of him. 
    The others are not so much present. Except for that particular one, one 
    left-over who misses a lot of attentions. Thinks herself very pitiful.&nbsp;</b>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">If ever I decide to 
    get rid of everything, they will take over. Sometimes they force upon me, a 
    single one or many of them at the same time. The more often they reach their 
    goal, the lesser it matters to me. I don’t have to live anymore, let they do 
    it for me. For the time being I am their manager. I can control them very 
    well and sometimes I do recall on them. Maybe it is caused by tensions. 
    Being in stress already too long. Maybe it is caused through the uploads. 
    Hopefully they will disappear just as calm as they had came into existence.</span></p>
