    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">When 
    I woke up there was a gray rabbit on my bed. The animal looked at me with 
    glassy eyes. Is this real, this rabbit? I wondered. Is it dead? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">From experience I know 
    that excessive morphine intake causes hallucinations. Carefully I tried to 
    stroke the animal. It didn’t disappear! I wouldn’t have been surprised if my 
    hand would have gone right through the rabbit. So it was really there and it 
    wasn’t even afraid of me. A nurse entered the room. Her unexpected entrance 
    startled me. I sat up with a start and the rabbit was gone. <i>“I saw you 
    were awake,”</i> the nurse said. <i>“I came right away to see how you’re 
    doing.”</i> How can I trust that this nurse is real? I asked myself. She 
    might disappear as suddenly as the rabbit did. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><i>“So, how are we 
    doing?”</i> She gave me such a stern look I thought I’d better answer her 
    promptly. Even if I was talking to thin air. <i>“Alright”</i> I answered 
    with great difficulty. My mouth was so dry! The nurse gave me some water 
    that I drank through a straw. Could she read my thoughts? My mouth sucked 
    the water up like cardboard and then I could speak more easily. But I had 
    nothing to say. The nurse did; she began speaking animatedly while she 
    inserted a thermometer in my mouth. <i>“Everyone is so excited about you. 
    You are the pearl of Braintec.” </i></span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">Before swine? </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">I thought immediately after she said it. <i>
    “Even Dr. Tachikawa, I have never seen him so enthusiastic! His eyes were 
    sparkling.”</i> The nurse rattled on and on and I found it hard to 
    concentrate. <i>“When he heard yesterday afternoon that you were getting a 
    MESI he flew over immediately. He was in Tokyo, you know. Or Osaka, some 
    meeting I believe. Well, isn’t that fantastic? When someone flies from one 
    side of the globe to the other just for you? He came to see you before 
    speaking to Dr. Hamilton. But you were sleeping. Oh, there’s the rabbit he 
    brought you. It’s attentive, isn’t it? And still there are people who say 
    he’s so cold. I don’t understand that at all. OK, he might be a little 
    distant in relationships, but he’s terribly kind. You should count yourself 
    lucky with all this attention.”</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family:Arial">She probably rattled on for minutes 
    after that but I stopped listening from the moment she put that rabbit back 
    on my lap. The gray animal took up all my attention. So it was there but it 
    was a toy. Apparently it was mine; I got it from Dr. Tachikawa. I’ve seen 
    some pictures of him, on the internet and so on, but I don’t know him. He, 
    apparently, is the man who invented the implants and their use. Must be a 
    clever man. And polite because he is Japanese. He flew to Portland just for 
    me. Well mostly for his MESI of course.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">But 
    why a rabbit? Must be a Japanese custom. It’s a cuddly rabbit. By now I can 
    tell she isn’t real, but it looks a lot like the real thing though. Her fur 
    is really soft and she’s got a cute mug. I pressed her softly against my 
    body while falling back to sleep. </span></p>
