    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">For 
    years and years I have dreamt, like every boy I think, that one day I would 
    step into the middle of an exciting adventure. And now it is, possibly, that 
    far. What do I do? Do I leave Braintec, after Sonja’s warning, or do I stay 
    and step into that probably dangerous adventure? I know I can stay calm and 
    controlled under most circumstances, but who knows this module in my head 
    will change that. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
    second hypnosis session with Rosanne didn’t make me much wiser. This time I 
    brought her into a deeper trance and with a detour, I made her a movie 
    director making a documentary of her youth I’ve got the truth out of it. 
    When I let her speak after the session the disbelief on her face was 
    enormous. Was that all? It is amazing how deep a person can slip away in 
    unaccepted belief. How a small detail can influence someone’s life. That 
    naughty girl with the braids on the second row in class can follow some 
    people for their whole life. Or the remarks of the teacher. Or like in 
    Rosanne’s case, the lost of a silver spoon. Her Grandmother told about it 
    all the time, how beautiful it was and when she was allowed to take it with 
    her to school it must have felt out of her bag. Who knows who found it.....

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">But my 
    decision it made, I stay because I want to know the ending, and not from the 
    newspaper, if it will ever come that far, but from the inside. This time I 
    choose adventure.</span></p>
