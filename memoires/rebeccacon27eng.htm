    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I woke up this excited 
    morning. I think it was because I knew I was going to get another upload. 
    Something about the ocean. Dr. Hamilton doesn't know that I saw what he 
    wrote in my file about which uploads I'll be receiving. I think I will not 
    mention it to him and act suprised every time.&nbsp; Even though I know it is 
    going to be about an ocean, it's all still very suprising. I love the ocean! 
    I wondered if it would be an east coast ocean or a west coast ocean. I have 
    been to both and they are two completely different experiences! But I loved 
    them both and I love the idea of getting an upload about one!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen was asleep when 
    I left. She didn't speak to me at all last night. I wonder if I did do 
    something to make her mad. I hope not. She is like a sister to me and I 
    would be horrified if I lost her friendship.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I arrived at Dr. 
    Hamilton's office he wasn't there. Where could he be I wondered? My high 
    spirits soon sank into my stomach when I noticed the envelope taped to his 
    door. My name was on the front of it. When I opened it, it read:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic">
    Rebecca, I am sorry to have to do this. I could tell yesterday that you were 
    very excited to receive a new upload. However, a situation has come up which 
    leaves me unable to perform the upload the morning. Will you please come 
    back around 6:00 this evening. I will arrange for you upload to take place 
    at that time. Thank you for understanding.</span></p>
