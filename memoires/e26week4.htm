    Although I admire Kodjiro a lot and although I’m madly in love with him, we 
    did get into a fight. I suppose he expects me to take everything for granted 
    and keep my mouth shut. Well, that’s not the way I am. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We walked over to his 
    apartment, after we spent another evening dining out. This afternoon I 
    understood from an e-mail that Hans and Heather, two new test subjects, are 
    in real trouble. Just before or after their operation, actually I do not 
    know exactly how the story goes, they got away with equipment of Braintec. 
    It is not my responsibility anymore assisting test subjects. However, this 
    time I couldn’t forget the incident. What the hell is going on in Portland? 
    On the other hand, and I’m not pleased at all, I have no news from Sonja for 
    such a long time. And Jessica, I’m dying to hear from her. Kodjiro knew more 
    about it, I was sure about that.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">So we were walking in 
    the street and I asked him to inform me about it. Kodjiro was acting as if 
    he didn’t understand my question. <i>“Please stop pretending you do not know 
    anything!”</i> I shouted all of a sudden. <i>“Why don’t you take me serious?”</i> 
    Kodjiro pushed me against the wall and squeezed my throat. Why on earth did 
    I ask him this in this small desolated alley and not in the middle of a busy 
    crossing loaded with people preventing him from murdering me?! 
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">Fortunately 
    Kodjiro took away his hands. I was coughing for more than five minutes 
    before I was able to breathe normally.<i> “You can trust me,”</i> I coughed,
    <i>“But can I trust you?”</i> Kodjiro was acting nervously and apologized 
    for his impulsive behavior. Afterwards he emphasized we shouldn’t have such 
    conversations on the open. We walked to his apartment without saying a word.
