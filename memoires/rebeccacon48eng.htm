    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After pondering the 
    letter and the other contents inside the envelope, I took a closer look at 
    the photo on the badge. It was the same strange man I saw earlier this 
    morning speaking with Dr. Hamilton and Rosanne. He was never here to 
    experience things for himself, like I previously thought. He was here for 
    other reasons. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It makes me wonder if 
    it was a coincidence that he was on the same plane as Rosanne and I, from 
    Germany. Could he have been following her in an undercover operation? He 
    must know about the romantic history she shared with Dr. Tachikawa. I wonder 
    if Rosanne is an accomplice? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Oh, I have so many 
    unanswered questions. I wonder why Dr. Tachikawa is after foreign 
    information. Could this be why he was terminated from his prior job as a 
    scientist in the CIA? What was the purpose of the extraction he took from 
    me? I have no useful information he might want. I am going to have to try to 
    find out who Kaleb Desmond is. Why would the CIA choose Megan, Me and this 
    guy to come in contact with? I can understand Megan, because of the position 
    her father use to work for. But why me? And what did Kaleb have to offer 
    them?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen knows the guy, 
    Jerry, at the front desk. He has all the room numbers of the test subjects. 
    I wonder if Carmen might be able to get a room number on </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Kaleb. I will ask her if 
    she will go talk to Jerry.</span></p>
