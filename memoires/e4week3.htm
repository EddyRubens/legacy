    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I’m getting along much 
    better with Dr. Tachikawa. He makes me feel valued and I think not just 
    because of the implant. As far as age is concerned he could have been my 
    father but he doesn’t treat me as his daughter. More as a lady. He makes it 
    clear that he likes me, and the feeling is mutual. And I’m not the only one; 
    there are more women here who’ve got a bit of a crush on him. Every now and 
    then curiosity turns to gossip. So I don’t know if it’s true, but he’s been 
    married three times apparently. Each marriage stranded because of his 
    ambitions. His first wife is said to have committed suicide because he was 
    more interested in how her brains worked than her personality. It appears 
    she didn’t speak for a year before she took an overdose of sleeping pills 
    with a bottle of saké. His second wife took off with someone else, someone 
    who did want to spend time with her. And his third wife is supposed to live 
    in Tokyo, where Dr. Tachikawa has an apartment. He doesn’t have children and 
    wouldn’t even have them if they paid him.&nbsp; Which is a huge problem for his 
    third wife because she would like to have a big family. I wonder where those 
    gossipers got all this information. Dr. Tachikawa may be very friendly and 
    polite, but he keeps to himself. He hardly ever lets people know how he 
    feels and what he thinks and is much too reserved to talk so openly about 
    his personal affairs. Others are more than willing to do that for him I 
    guess. </span></p>
