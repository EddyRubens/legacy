    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I’m 
    lying here waiting for the clock to finally strike six. I just can’t sleep; 
    I keep looking at the clock. Soon I will go into a deep – very deep – sleep. 
    And then when I wake up there will be an implant inside my head. I’ve been 
    warned that I will feel terribly sick after the operation. Strange, that I’m 
    still really looking forward to it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Such misery</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">!
    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I’m sick, just like they said, 
    feeling awful. I’ve thrown up three times already, but I only gave up 
    liquids and acid. Generally, I van endure pain pretty well, but not feeling 
    sick like this. And I can’t remember ever having a hangover this big. My 
    head feels like a rock. The slightest movement, even blinking an eyelid, 
    makes me feel as if swords are slashing right through me. And the nausea. 
    They warned me about that as well. If I had known it was going to be as bad 
    as this I would have thought again before giving them permission to go ahead 
    with this. Being sick is no tea party, but this queasiness feels like dying. 
    I’m glad they’re not cutting down on medication. Maybe I can get some more 
    morphine.&nbsp;For sure I’m making the nurse go mad with all my nagging. But it’s 
    this nausea, it’s so awful. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Thankfully the 
    operation went well. At least that’s what the doctors are saying. Feeling 
    sick and getting headaches is part of this. I didn’t dare to think it was 
    going to be this bad. I’m lying here attached to these monitors with my head 
    covered by a massive bandage. Underneath this bandage is this hatch made of 
    skin that must close and behind that is the hole they drilled where they 
    then put the implant. My body hasn’t rejected it so far. Almost immediately 
    after my return to the recovery room I was given a test. Not another test! 
    At least this one was short and simple. Jessica held up pieces of cardboard 
    in various colors which I was to name. It made me so angry that I couldn’t 
    think of the word cardboard. I almost panicked, even though it was explained 
    beforehand that this might happen. They told me I ought to be happy that I 
    remember colors and should have patience. After that they left me alone. I’m</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial"> 
    glad. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">After all that I slept for 
    quite a long time and by all accounts am doing OK. Still, I’m very tired and 
    the nausea is driving me insane. Couldn’t they come up with a pill for that? 
    Darn. It’s very distressful not being able to go to the toilet by myself.
