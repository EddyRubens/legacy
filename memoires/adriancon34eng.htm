    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">At 
    Narita Airport I called Rosanne. How glad I was when she answered right away! 
    In this mega-big city I really don’t know where to go to. She explained how 
    to take the train to Shinjuku Station and how to buy a ticket. <i>“But as 
    far as I can see it is all so busy and huge here. We must meet at a certain 
    spot.” “Right opposite to the head entrance of the Shinjuku Station is a 
    Music Store.”</i> She said. <i>“You can’t miss it. A large advertising sign 
    from ‘The Yellow Monkey’ hangs above the entrance. “The Yellow What?”</i> I 
    asked. Did I hear it correctly? <i>“Monkey” </i>Rosanne said. I was doubled 
    over with laughter. <i>“The Yellow Monkey is a rock band here in Japan. They 
    are terribly popular”</i> she explained to me.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I entered the 
    station I saw her standing. Right in front of the music store. How glad I 
    was to see her. <i>“Oh Rosanne, what I have been through the last couple of 
    days”,</i> I started. <i>“I want to tell you all about it, but I’m so tired.” 
    “Come with me to my apartment. There we can talk further.” “You have you own 
    apartment, how wonderful, finally some rest.”</i> It took all the weight 
    from my shoulders. <i>“I would like to stay in there for the first two”,</i> 
    said Rosanne. <i>“There is so much going on here. I shall tell you all about 
    it, but not here on the street.”</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Her 
    apartment was a dark hole. The windows were closed with some kind of panels 
    that couldn’t open. There where mats on the ground and there was only a few 
    furniture. <i>“You moved in here recently, didn’t you?” “This is my first 
    time to enter it.”</i> Rosanne said. <i>“And it is only for one night. We 
    must find something else tomorrow.”</i> I threw my backpack from my back and 
    we settled down. I closed my eyes for only one short moment. Rosanne came 
    next to me and started to fiddle. In my hair, behind my ears. How strong he 
    was! <i>“He wants me”</i> I thought. Suddenly I came back into reality. 
    Rosanne frightened and rubbed her eyes. We gave each other a questioning 
    look. <i>“You’ve got money uploads as well?” “Yes, Kodjiro gave me, it 
    confuses me completely.”</i> Said Rosanne. <i>“I have a whole box with me. 
    He sent them to me.” </i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I told her about my 
    evening walks in the forest and about the stream and the journey in the 
    airplane. <i>“According to that man from the F.B.I. Kodjiro is not to be 
    trusted. I don’t know which one to believe.”</i> Rosanne told me her story. 
    It dizzied me. The meeting with Sonja. Hans’ and Heater’s wanderings. It all 
    was too much to me. <i>“We must consider this very carefully.”</i> But I 
    couldn’t. I was too tired. My head was spinning. The most of all I wanted to 
    sleep. <i>“Do you want something to eat for tonight?”</i> I asked Rosanne.
    <i>“There is nothing here and I don’t want to leave the house.”</i> Like two 
    small monkeys, close to each other we fell asleep at the futon.</span></p>
