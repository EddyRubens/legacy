    moustache was waiting for me at the exit of the transit zone. I recognized 
    him immediately by the sign he was holding. A sign in white and red 
    mentioning “<i>Braintec</i>”. I moved uncertainly towards this man, ‘coss I 
    could always decide to walk straight past him with in cold blood. </span>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">A short eye contact was 
    enough for the man with the moustache to recognize me so there was no reason 
    to play unknown. He took over my luggage and shouted in my ear. </span>

    introduced himself as John, John McKenzie. He is an assistant of Braintec, a 
    jack-of-all-trades. He seems to be okay, just like all the Americans, but 
    that might not be his true nature. I don’t like men with moustaches. They 
    always have something to hide. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">My room seems to be 
    just fine. It is bigger than I suspected and it has its own little bathroom. 
    Just like a hotel. They kindly leave me alone for a couple of hours, after 
    I’ve endured the necessary greetings. First I will take a long shower, put 
    my clothes in the wardrobe and look how much television cannels I can get. 
    Then, after my guided tour through the building and the mandatory shaking of 
    hands, I’ll ask around for a plug adapter. I’ll need one for my computer; 
    the batteries are almost empty. </span></p>
