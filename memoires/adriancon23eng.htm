    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
    Extractions. That’s how today started. There has been made a rather tight 
    schedule for me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Hamilton 
    invited me yesterday for lunch in a delicate facility at Portland’s yacht 
    harbour. Money is clearly back in town. Hamilton thought it was time to 
    share our thoughts. That’s how he described the meaning of this appointment. 
    He was very considerate and asked me several questions which I had to answer 
    frankly. For example if I wanted to stay, now some people had left. And if I 
    still trusted the organization. I told him that I definitely wanted to stay. 
    And concerning my trust in Braintec I told him that I was disappointed in 
    the way he handled Rosanne. That issue was one of the things he wished to 
    discuss with me. And Sonja. That was obvious. The exodus from Braintec was 
    concerning him. I told him I know nothing more about Sonja than he does. 
    That she’s still missing and a bit confused according to me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">About 
    Rosanne I have been very honest. I have persuaded him that it’s for certain 
    people with a tendency obviously some kind of addiction to get an upload 
    every couple of days. There’s nothing wrong with that as long as it are nice 
    memories. He agreed on that one, but it couldn’t be right when we were going 
    to write down our own “prescriptions”. Too many uploads can putt someone off 
    his stroke. Yes, prescriptions was the word he used. Even he saw the uploads 
    as some kind of drug or medicine. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">About myself I have 
    been honest as well. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
    That I longed for a new upload every time. What I felt when I needed one. 
    The emptiness that needed to be filled up. The nicely drifting away into 
    something not yourself. The expanding of my whole being into a multiple 
    character. About the leaps in time you were able to make. About the 
    experience suddenly being in another body, man, woman, child, old. Hamilton 
    listened intensely and was quiet for a long time after I finished. He 
    hesitantly broke the silence when he said: <i>“Have you ever spoke to Sheila 
    about this, about these experiences?”</i> I said that I mentioned it to 
    Sheila and to Jessica as well, but that only Jessica asked me once what it 
    was doing to me and what it meant to me. If he wanted it to be further 
    investigated, then absolutely not by Sheila. I said to him: <i>“It is a 
    matter of trust if you talk about this with someone else. And I don’t feel 
    that trust with Sheila.”</i> Hamilton said he could understand that. After 
    some hesitation he added: <i>“It seems to be my job to recollect all the 
    sheep across the whole world.”</i> This was the father behind the salesman 
    speaking. That was obvious. <i>“If you adopt such an attitude I give you a 
    change to convince both Jessica and Rosanne to come back. “ </i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">About 
    Rosanne he said that she had been invaluable for the project. About her 
    power of persuasion to recruit new test subjects. And her commercial skills.
    <i>“After all it was she who managed to make contacts with the Dutch 
    Ministry of Defense for a very special project,”</i> said Hamilton. <i>“But 
    that’s not the only reason why I would like to have her back here, she has 
    so much experience. That is invaluable for us.” “What is preventing you?”</i> 
    I said. <i>“E-mail, write, apologize and tell her how you really think about 
    her and let her know that you’re really worried about her health.” “Speaking 
    about health,”</i> Hamilton said. <i>“For you we must arrange a very strict 
    schedule for the uploads and extractions”. “I suggest: an extraction every 
    two days and an upload every third day, take it or leave it.”</i> I needed 
    some time to think about this. He was suddenly very stern, as the father of 
    the company. I accepted his suggestion anyway without having a discussion. 
    Finally he had the best in mind for all of us, not only for the company, but 
    clearly for us. That is what this conversation was showing.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">When we 
    walked outside at the car park after the conversation I asked: <i>&quot;Have you 
    ever thought about having an implant yourself?” “Yes, of course, several 
    times. Especially when I saw your enthusiastic faces after a successful 
    upload.” “Why don’t you have one yet?”</i> I asked him. <i>“Maybe later, 
    when I’m old. At this moment I have too much on my mind.”</i> We smiled when 
    we stepped in and drove back to Braintec. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">We didn’t 
    spoke about Steward and neither about Dr. Tachikawa. That made me thinking. 
    Was it coincidence, did it matter? I kept it the way it was. That Hamilton 
    wasn’t a bad guy. He wanted the best for us.</span></p>
