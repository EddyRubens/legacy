    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Tomorrow I will return 
    to Portland. Time flies extremely fast and I’m afraid this is such a holiday 
    from which you’ll have to recover when you are home again. A real working 
    holiday. Due to all those presentations I have seen a lot of Holland. 
    Tonight there will be another presentation held in Eindhoven and then I’ve 
    finished it.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Maybe it is too early 
    imagining how it felt to be here but the idea that I couldn’t find my feet 
    is forcing upon me. What did I expect from the two weeks in Holland? Maybe I 
    had hoped secretly that my return home would have a special place. One of 
    the reasons why I am in Holland is the fact that I had to find again some of 
    my roots. The thing I found again is the anxiety which got me out Holland at 
    the time. I’m glad I have my family and it’s good to acknowledge family ties. 
    But at the same time I’m glad that I return to Braintec tomorrow. Again I 
    feel that good-tempered breath into my neck.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    only moment when I really felt my roots was when I looked through the old 
    photo-albums. When I cleared them up I nosed about the attic. There is a lot 
    of rubbish out there. I wonder why my mother hasn’t thrown it away yet. 
    People can relate memories to matter and then find it hard to get rid of it. 
    Behind the suitcases with summer clothes and the boxes with 
    Christmas-decorations I found a large carton. It was properly sealed and 
    nowhere on it was written what was inside. It made me curious. Carefully I 
    prized off the small strings and scotch tape and opened the box. There were 
    three fully loaded trash bags in it. I opened the first one and my mouth 
    fell open with surprise. My old soft cuddly toys! Brammetje and Snowball! 
    Femke and Stampertje! I immediately opened the other bags. All my friends 
    were still there and they stared at me with great expectation. They had been 
    lying on this attic for years! Neatly wrapped, but still had become a bit 
    mouldy. I suddenly started to cry. One by one I cuddled the soft animals. 
    They comforted me and I did comfort them too because they had been locked up 
    for such a long time in those plastic bags. Oh, and Goldie! I almost forgot.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I have washed half of 
    the cuddly toys. Couldn’t get more into the washing-machine. The other half 
    I will wash in the Research Centre. Obviously I will take all of them with 
    me. They are better friends than, for example, Jeanine. Brammetje will never 
    ever complain about the danger of an implant in my head. And Sjakie really 
    likes it when I talk about Kodjiro all the time. When my mother saw me 
    playing with my cuddly toys she got mad. <i>“Aren’t you far too old for that?”</i> 
    she asked cynical. <i>“I’m never too old for love and affection, dear mother!”</i> 
    I answered.</span></p>
