    jacket became grey and all the other colors from the trees, the grass and

    totally panicked. The adrenaline stiffed my body. I had an unreal feeling; 
    all of a sudden I realized that my whole life was just a movie. The heads of 
    that VCR definitely needed to be changed!&nbsp;Sally and Adrian brought 
    me to Dr. Hamilton. </span><span style="font-family: Arial">He immediately 
    tried to make an EEG registration.&nbsp; I flipped even more, ‘coss in my 
    paranoid thoughts it was Braintec who had put me in this movie. I screamed 
    and lashed out, shouting that I wanted out. They had to knock me out with an 
    injection. The colors were back to normal when I woke up. It is still 
    unknown why they had disappeared. My whole brain has been extensively 
    screened and it seems to be working perfectly. The eyes were fine as well. 
    Because no reason was found for this malfunction, the diagnosis is a 
    temporary drop out or some kind of hallucination.&nbsp; Whatever it was, I hope 
    it won’t come back. Especially that paranoia scared me shitless.</span></p>
