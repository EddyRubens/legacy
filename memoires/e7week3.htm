    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Tachikawa asked me 
    this afternoon if I had really cooked my own dinner as he was told. I 
    confirmed that. He gave me a pat on the back and said that he already knew 
    I’m a good woman. <i>“Despite of that we will go to the Kaiseki Ryori again, 
    this evening,”</i> he whispered in my ear. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial"><i>“Do you think I’m still 
    welcome there?”</i> </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I asked him 
    astonished, but he was already heading for the door. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">He walked through the corridor 
    without turning back. </span>
    </b></p>
   
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">The rest of the day he ignored me. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">I had misbehaved myself so much the previous 
    time that I couldn’t believe he meant it. Why would he invite me a second 
    time for dinner? </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Maybe he 
    dislikes eating alone. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">He has to, 
    ‘coss he did turn up knocking at my door at eight o’clock. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Fortunately I was ready to go.
    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">We didn’t speak while we drove to the 
    Ryori. Usually I prefer this silence, but tonight I felt kind of awkward. 
    Does he suspect something from me? I tried to find a good question to start 
    a conversation, but I couldn’t find one. This evening I wouldn’t drink too 
    much, I quietly resolved to do so. Otherwise Dr. Tachikawa might get a bad 
    image of me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">We were 
    kindly greeted when we entered the Ryori and were escorted to the same table 
    as last week. So they weren’t forgotten us. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">After a couple of glasses filled with a very 
    special wine we started to talk. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Especially I did. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Tachikawa wanted to know everything 
    about me and the love affairs I was into. Those two or three glasses were 
    enough to blur my natural borders so I told him shamelessly about every 
    secret and naughty detail he wanted to know. He started to giggle childlike 
    when I told him about a petting on the dog-sledge while the snow buzzed 
    twenty centimeter underneath me. His eyes were full of wickedness. He 
    touched my hand and said: <i>“Otemba. </i></span><i>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">That’s what you are</span></i><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial"><i>, 
    Otemba!”</i> Whatever that means! I quess it’s some kind of nickname. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">He repeated it when we said good night to 
    each other. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-weight:700">Satisfied with the good 
    company, the lovely food and last but certainly not least the wine, I dreamt 
    a bit further. It was a nice evening. I’ve got the absolute feeling that 
    I’ve got it all in my hands and that I can do anything I wish to do with it. 
    Gorgeous.</span></p>
