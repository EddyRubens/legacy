    <p><span style="font-family:Arial">Long, long night, but not a bad night.&nbsp; 
    More of a learning experience kind of night. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family:Arial">I wonder if the intention behind the 
    M-stores and memory enhancements, and the memorex replacement cartridges is 
    to get us to move towards creating our own experiences, to eliminate our 
    dependency on them.&nbsp; It really feels like I am dependent on them.&nbsp; But, 
    maybe there is no intention behind it at all.&nbsp; If scientists, of any other 
    breed of human, wanted us to do something, then they wouldn't be scientists.&nbsp; 
    They are the passive types.&nbsp; They are supposed to sit back and act like they 
    aren't&nbsp; human.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family:Arial">I need to make a running list of things 
    that have happened.&nbsp; Might as well start with tonight.&nbsp; It's actually 7:00 
    a.m.&nbsp; Met Roseann last night.&nbsp; She was wearing a hot, sexy dress.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 
    just great.&nbsp; White, almost see-through shirt.&nbsp; I've told myself a thousand 
    times, it's not about the body.&nbsp; It's not about the sex, but damn it if I 
    wasn't feeling my oats last night.&nbsp; We were sitting outside, it was one of 
    the first warm evenings that have come across the campus this winter.&nbsp; I 
    still had on a jacket.&nbsp; She was wearing a trenchcoat, kind of like a mobster.&nbsp; 
    Her hair was down.&nbsp; One of the first times I've seen it down.&nbsp; I usually see 
    her at meetings, and she has just woken up, or come down from a memory 
    enhancement engine session, so she's not worried about what people are 
    thinking, she's been so busy being someone else. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family:Arial">We finished our third beer, and she 
    suggested we have whiskey, so that meant going into the campus bar.&nbsp; We 
    walked in.&nbsp; Here's what I remember.&nbsp; She took off her coat, and she was 
    wearing that see-through white shirt, and no bra underneath.&nbsp; I could see 
    the tiny outline of her left nipple, it was brushing against the fabric in 
    the shadowy light.&nbsp; I tried not to look, but I was drunk enough that it 
    looked like I was falling over staring.&nbsp; She didn't notice, because she left, 
    walked away into the bathrooms or down some hallway.&nbsp; I followed her, took 
    her arm, and as we turned the corner I pressed myself against her back.&nbsp; I 
    whispered to her that we needed to talk, to get out some of these issues 
    that we kept avoiding.&nbsp; I could feel it, i wondered if she could feel it, 
    too.&nbsp; She nodded. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family:Arial">We went back to my apartment.&nbsp; She had 
    some vodka.&nbsp; I poured some whiskey.&nbsp; We each took off our shirts, and I 
    massaged her back.&nbsp; It was great to actually feel skin through my own hands, 
    and not through some neurotransmitted appearance.&nbsp; What was so wonderful was 
    how her skin flushed and&nbsp; her back arched, showing her beautiful neck.&nbsp; Then 
    she sighed, and fell asleep.&nbsp; I wanted to kiss her neck, and then her back, 
    between the shoulderblades, but I didn't.&nbsp; I wanted her to be awake when 
    that happened.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p><span lang="NL" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I also 
    wanted her to be entirely naked with me, but I think that this won't 
    happen.&nbsp; she seems so shy, not wanting to turn and face me with her bare 
    chest.&nbsp; I am kind of shy too, not knowing what she will think about what the 
    protein enhancement has done to my body.</span></p>
