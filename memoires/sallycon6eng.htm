    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I don’t like it that 
    kathy is leaving. With her i could chat about everything and sometimes i had 
    the feeling that she might be a real friend. We promised to write but i am 
    afraid we won’t. Usually such a promise doesn’t stand and the writing stops 
    soon. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">But i can understand 
    why kathy wants to leave. I think about leaving as well. I have been here 
    for quite a long time and the kick from the beginning is over. Not that 
    there’re no surprises, there are, but seldom nice ones. For example those 
    fights. I don’t want to experience such situations. It doesn’t feel good. 
    Then i think about going home. I am rather unstable about this, because i 
    like those memories. And sometimes it is exciting, like the ear dropping on 
    Steward.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Perhaps i must go home 
    for a couple of days. That might be possible. I went home during christmas 
    and new years eve and that wasn’t a problem either. And rosanne got her 
    permission and Adrian went away for a couple of days to a crater lake. I 
    would go home then to think about my future. I might be going back to the 
    university. That is perhaps the good influence of a memory they gave me 
    yesterday. I don’t know whose it was but it was about college. There was a 
    lot to laugh about and i felt great. Now I want to go to college again. 
    Therefore it was a good memory and perhaps the whole Braintec thing was good 
    because of that. I was studying tourism but I could go through with that. I 
    never went to school with joy. It wasn’t too difficult but i had 
    difficulties with concentration and got bad remarks. My parents found being 
    happy more important and suggested to raise a family. How could i be happy 
    if i didn’t know what i wanted? I still don’t know, but braintec helps me 
    with that. Now i know many things are possible. I think i am really into 
    adventures. Therefore i will go back to college and finish my education. 
    Working in tourism is better for me than the boutique.</span></p>
