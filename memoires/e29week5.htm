    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">We 
    took a taxi to the mentioned address. It was a temple. Rather pretty looking 
    actually, very Japanese. But we haven’t come here acting like tourists. We 
    were hiding behind a stand selling incense sticks and amulets with Japanese 
    characters. From here we had a reasonable overview. What now? We hadn’t the 
    slightest idea what was going on here. Maybe we were located on the wrong 
    spot.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Then Adrian recognized 
    them. He touched me and was pointing into the direction of two tourists 
    walking out of the temple. <i>“Hans and Heather,”</i> he whispered. The two 
    seemed to enjoy themselves. They were talking to each other. Then Hans 
    nodded and they walked together with the boy. We had no idea what was going 
    on, but we felt in our bones that Hans and Heather were in great danger. <i>
    “We will follow them, alright?”</i> Adrian asked and I nodded. It was 
    exciting and also a bit scaring. There were many people near the temple and 
    that’s why nobody had noticed us. Now we were walking though small alleys. 
    We remained at a distance although we didn’t want to loose them out of sight. 
    Then all of a sudden they entered a building.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was a small 
    eating-place, like Tokyo has thousands of them. So what should we do? Going 
    inside. <i>“If we don’t do anything maybe those people will get murdered,”</i> 
    I whispered. <i>“We’ll have to!”</i> Adrian nodded and after a meaningful 
    look we stormed inside. The small restaurant was empty. <i>“See that door 
    over there!”</i> Adrian pointed and we rushed to it. It all went so fast. We 
    entered a small room where we saw, apart from Hans and Heather, about six or 
    seven Japanese. I recognized Kodjiro. <i>“Quick, you have to get out of here!”
    </i>Adrian was screaming. <i>“They are going to kill you!”</i> Heather 
    passed us running to the door, but Hans had no chance to escape. The 
    Japanese boy held him very tight. Adrian jumped on top of them and pulled 
    away the boy. In that way also Hans could ran away. Two men I recognized 
    from the meeting at the blood-bank were running behind him. The other men 
    were heading towards Adrian. They were shouting something in Japanese 
    language. Three of them were holding him tight. Kodjiro came to me and 
    grabbed my arm.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian screamed. 
    Suddenly I got furious. I seemed to grow, well, that’s how it felt. Never 
    before I felt so strong. I jumped onto the fighting men and was biting and 
    pulling any spot I could manage. I had become a wild animal! Blind anger was 
    going on and on. Special effect for Adrian managed to escape. Then somebody 
    grabbed my hair and pushed a needle into my neck. It was Kodjiro. He snarled 
    something in Japanese and after that they were all chasing Adrian. Suddenly 
    I got very tired and fell on the ground. Kodjiro pulled me on a chair and 
    wiped off the clammy sweat from my forehead<i>. “It won’t take long,”</i> he 
    said. <i>“Within a few minutes you will be yourself again.”</i> Indeed 
    dizziness seemed to disappear. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“I want you to 
    bite me,”</span></i></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><b> Kodjiro said. I 
    looked at him fully surprised. Was this a dream? Did he give me a poisonous 
    injection and was I already on the other side? <i>”I want you to bite me 
    here, here in my underarm.”</i> Kodjiro was saying it clear. He had rolled 
    up his shirt. I looked at him wondering. “<i>Bite me as hard as you can, 
    then I will let go. That’s all I can do for you.”</i> He was sweet, I was 
    sure of that. All my doubts disappeared. Kodjiro has always been kind to me 
    but he’s in a wasp’s nest, just like me. <i>“Just do it Rosanne, do it now 
    for we have not much time left.”</i> I had bitten him as hard as I could. <i>
    “Harder, harder,”</i> Kodjiro hissed and he pinched me in my side. That hurt 
    a lot. Through that pain I could bite even harder. I tasted blood and 
    withdrew. Kodjiro took me in his arms and kissed me passionately. <i>“Next 
    time I’ll probably have to kill you,”</i> he said. <i>“Goodbye dear Otemba, 
    now you have to run!”</i> For a second I looked at his bleeding arm and 
    rushed outside. Although the street was empty I was running as fast as I 
    could.</b></span></p>
