    indeed, the lady from California arrived as the first of today’s new test 
    subjects. Her private driver dropped her at eleven o’clock precisely. She 
    brought halve of her household and she gave orders to everyone. I was 
    surprised to find myself standing on a stool with Dr. Hamilton, fixing a 
    curtain with a disgusting flowery design in front of her window. Her room 
    was transformed into a chic hotel suite within a few moments. It isn’t 
    difficult to give her the special treatment Dr. Hamilton had asked for. She 
    commands it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The other newcomers 
    arrived one by one during the day. A young girl from Tacoma; Kathy. She 
    makes a funny contrasts sharply with Matthew; a man that could well be her 
    grandfather. Last but not least we have two students; Mark and Jeromy.

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">It is going to get 
    overcrowded if we welcome five new test subjects every week. I am afraid 
    that won’t improve the atmosphere. Especially not if more of them are like 
    that lady from California. Adelle is her name. With a double L. I have never 
    seen someone overreact this much when his or her name was misspelled. 
    Jessica and I exchanged some knowing glances. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Adelle is definitely getting on my nerves. She figured that our towels 
    wouldn’t be soft enough for her, so I could have them back. That didn’t 
    surprise me. But I was quite shocked when it became clear she worries about 
    her own towels as well. She wants to be sure that our laundry service is 
    sufficient enough and even got me to check that for her! This lady is 
    driving me crazy!</span></p>
