	<span style="font-family:Arial">Diego, Carmen, Josh and I went back to their 
	suite to have dinner. Josh and Diego called the guest store to have some 
	items delivered. Carmen and I toured the massive suite. It had two bedrooms, 
	two bathrooms, a living room a kitchen and a beautiful balcony. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Josh mentioned that he brought along his 
	computer. He was more than thrilled to find that the room also had Internet 
	access. I was tempted to check my emails to see if Megan had sent anything 
	else. I also was curious as to whether or not Mr. Isakova sent any kind of a 
	response. But I was with Josh, and I knew it was important to us both to 
	just let it go for a while. Twenty minutes had passed since Josh and Diego 
	ordered from the store. Josh said he was starving and was going to head down 
	to the store to pick up the items himself. He asked if I wanted to come for 
	a walk. I agreed. Anytime with my guy away from those creepy Agents was a 
	bonus.<br>
	Diego and Carmen had wandered into Diego's room. I was sure that he had many 
	questions about the baby and since they could be alone, he would probably 
	reveal what he knew.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Josh and I&nbsp; walked slowly down the hall hand 
	in hand, to the staircase. We went down talking about things we would do 
	once this was all over. Josh had a huge vacation in mind. I told him how 
	terrific that all sounded, though, I personally wanted to spend some time at 
	home with him and Bruce. When we got to the little store it was empty. We 
	had to wait around for about ten minutes for someone to return. When the 
	young boy (about 16) returned, he was out of breath. <i>&quot;Can I help you?&quot;
	</i>he said to Josh. <i>&quot;Yeah, I'm in Suite 105. I called in an order about 
	half an hour ago. I just came to pick it up.&quot; </i>Josh replied. <i>&quot;Okay... 
	Uh... I don't have any order from Suite 105...You sure you got the right 
	room mister?&quot; </i>he said. Josh just looked at him for a moment like he was 
	thinking of something to say. He ended up telling the kid to forget about 
	it. As we headed back up the stairs, Josh mentioned something about ordering 
	out for some food. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When we got to the top of the staircase, 
	Josh leaned over and kissed me. This was a different kiss than he had done 
	before. This one truly showed love, passion and desire. He whispered into my 
	ear that he loved me. I pulled back a bit so that I could look into his 
	eyes. &quot;<i>Really, Josh?&quot;</i> I said to him. <i>&quot;We have been friends for a 
	very long time,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;And our romantic relationship is still 
	very new, but I really do love you. And I want you to remember that I will 
	do everything I can to help you and make this mess go away.&quot; </i>Josh pulled 
	me close to him and held me tight. I wanted to cry because I was so happy. I 
	could only wish all my troubles would just disappear.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Our few moments of bliss were interrupted 
	with a shrieking sound of desperation coming from down the hall. It was 
	Diego. He was screaming for help. <i>&quot;Something's wrong with Carmen! 
	Something is wrong with Carmen!&quot;</i></span></p>
