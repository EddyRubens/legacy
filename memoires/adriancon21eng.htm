    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adelle entered my room 
    at the arranged time. She was very nervous. <i>“Can you do this on your own?”</i> 
    she asked worriedly. Was she concerned about me or about herself, I wondered. 
    I guess a bit of both. <i>“Everything went fine with Rosanne, so why would 
    it go wrong with you”</i> I answered comforting her. I poured out a cup of 
    tea for her to please. She set down and relaxed a bit. I arranged the 
    equipment and cleared the network for the better work. <i>“Are you ready for 
    this”</i> I asked. <i>“I really don’t know what you’re up to see, but it 
    won’t be easy.” </i>Adelle groped about in her handbag and got an injection 
    needle out of it. <i>“In case I’m freaking out, morphine, because I can’t 
    answer for the consequences with a combination of sex and violence.” </i>She 
    put the needle on the table and made me solemnly promise to use it if she 
    couldn’t calm down after the upload. <i>“Go ahead”</i>, she said and I 
    started the whole circus. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Adelle sat defeated 
    in the chair when the upload was finished. <i>“I didn’t know people were 
    able doing this. It was terribly disgusting”</i>. Pulling her head she sat 
    sadly coiled up in her chair. <i>“How can I ever look Steward in his face?”</i> 
    without puking in front of his feet. After ten minutes the images were shown 
    on the computer screen.&nbsp;It was absolutely pornography of the lowest kind. 
    After a minute I switched the monitor off and copied the file to a back-up 
    computer in Elgin through the internet.&nbsp;After that I deleted the original. 
    So, Stewards days here in Portland are counted. Adelle agreed on that one. 
    We chatted a bit about what happened lately. Adelle was also wondering what 
    was going on, but she let me know that she was sure that I knew where 
    Rosanne is. <i>”It is for the best that I and everyone else don’t know where 
    she is.”</i> Adelle stood up and took the morphine shoot from the table. She 
    threw it in the trashcan after she emptied it in the washbasin. <i>“So, now 
    the bacteria’s in the purification plant will have a great day tomorrow. 
    They are without troubles for a while. All that dirt confronting these 
    animals day and night, I don’t understand how they can survive that.” </i>We 
    burst out laughing. It was the release of all the tensions.</span></p>
