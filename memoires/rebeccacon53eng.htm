    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen and I went to 
    go meet Kaleb Desmond. We knocked on his door, But all we could hear was 
    loud music blasting from inside. Carmen started banging on the door. When it 
    finally opened it, we got our first glance at Kaleb. He was very attractive. 
    He was tall, about six feet, blue eyes, black hair and was very much in 
    shape. It was obvious because he was wearing no shirt. We both must have 
    been staring because he finally said, <i>&quot;Yea?&quot;</i> It took me a moment to 
    realize it was our turn to respond. <i>&quot;Oh...I'm Rebecca and this is Carmen. 
    We are in the room right around the corner from you.&quot; &quot;Is my music too loud?&quot;
    </i>he said. <i>&quot;Oh...No!&quot;</i> I answered. <i>&quot;We actually came over here 
    because we wanted to meet you.&quot; </i>He gave us a sheepish smile and said, <i>
    &quot;Thanks, but I've got a lot going on right now. I don't have a lot of time 
    to date. But, you girls are cute! Thanks anyway!&quot;</i> and then he closed the 
    door.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen and I looked at 
    each other and laughed a little. <i>&quot;Great!&quot;</i> Carmen said. <i>&quot;He thinks 
    we were here to hit on him. Typical male!&quot; </i>She started banging on the 
    door again. She looked at me and said, <i>&quot;This time let me do the talking!&quot;</i> 
    He opened the door again. He raised his eyebrows and smiled. <i>&quot;Back so 
    soon ladies?&quot; </i>he said.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen walked right by 
    him and went into his room. She grabbed my hand and pulled me in after her. 
    He had a confused look on his face and he was getting ready to say something 
    when Carmen interrupted and said, <i>&quot;Look buddy your very cute. You know it, 
    I know it, and she knows it! </i>(She pointed at me) <i>But, there's some 
    serious and life threatening shit going on around here! And, we think you 
    either have something to do with it or know something about it!&quot; </i>He 
    stared at us for a minute. I think he must have been trying to think of 
    something to say. He took a quick glance out into the hall, like he was 
    making sure that no one over heard, then he closed the door.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;What do you guys 
    want?&quot;</i> he said.<i> &quot;I'm here for the same reasons you are, you know...memory 
    uploads.&quot; &quot;What do you think we are, stupid?&quot;</i> Carmen said to him. I was 
    worried that if she pissed him off, he might kick us out of his room. Then 
    we would be back to square one. I decided to interrupt, <i>&quot;We happen to 
    know that you have been contacted by a specific agency...&quot;</i> (I handed him 
    the copy of the CIA badge) He stared at the paper and asked, <i>&quot;Where did 
    you get this?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot;</i> I continued, <i>&quot;...for some reason the CIA 
    decided to contact Me and our friend Megan. We also know that they were 
    trying to contact you. What's this all about? What's going on?&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He stared at us then 
    back down at the CIA badge copy. Finally he let out a sigh and said, <i>&quot;OK, 
    you girls seem to already know more than you should. I get the feeling I can 
    trust you. But...you have to swear...what I'm about to tell </i></span><i>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">you, doesn't leave this 
    room!&quot;</span></i></p>
