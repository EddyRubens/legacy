    <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-weight: 700">It is not only Adelle 
    who can remember so intensively! This morning I got an upload of the memory 
    of Lucas’ parent’s home and I felt very confused all morning.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">I remembered a decent interior of a 
    home. A protected environment. I was brought up here with my father, mother 
    and older brother. It is that particular brother I cannot let go. I never 
    had a brother. Two sisters alright, but that is completely different. My 
    brother Tom was some kind of a hero to me. Actually his name was Thomas, but 
    we always called him Tom. Sometimes it is boring to have a brother. He has a 
    larger room, was allowed to stay up late and had more football-pictures than 
    I had. Whenever I bought a package containing a rare picture, my luck only 
    lasted for a very short time. In one way or another he managed to manipulate 
    me in such a way that I exchanged my picture for a pile of doubles which he 
    said were worth double as much. However, I love Tom. If somebody teased me 
    or if I had a fight with mom, he always helped me out. Everything I knew 
    about the girls, I knew from him. He even sometimes helped me with my 
    homework! And whenever he had nobody to play with, we played soccer together 
    in the garden. There we had this huge goal. Of course Tom could play soccer 
    better than I did. He was good in everything and wanted everybody to know. I 
    suppose I have lived years and years in Tom’s shadow.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">Once I could really kill him. Although I 
    had horrible acne I finally found a girl-friend. Her name was Linda. I was 
    mad about Linda and especially about her long hair. Linda was dressed in the 
    latest fashion and was a star in tennis. I thought I was gonna marry Linda. 
    Together we would buy this large house with a dog. But my brother liked 
    Linda as well. That bad, that he joined us to the movies. He insisted 
    bringing her home that night. Since then Linda was no longer my girl-friend 
    anymore. The worst thing was that he gave up on her after only a couple of 
    weeks. Short afterwards Tom went to university and left home to live on his 
    own. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-weight: 700">Time heals all wounds 
    and now I love Tom again, just as much as before I started going out with 
    Linda. I really miss him. Since I moved to Ireland a few years ago due to my 
    work, I haven’t seen him that often. He was not there at Christmas Eve! Now 
    that I’m here in Portland, Tom feels so far away. Shall I call him? 
    Immediately I shake off this whole idea. Who the hell is Tom?&nbsp; </span></p>
