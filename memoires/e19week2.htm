    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“Are you coming to 
    Mr. Soesasji’s garden this afternoon?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    Dr. Tachikawa asked me after the meeting. <i>“Of course! I’d love to!”</i> 
    Again I reacted much too enthusiastic. Both of us had to organize a few 
    things so we made an appointment at 4 p.m. Time goes slow when you’re 
    looking forward to something. We drove to the garden in his car and had some 
    tea with Mr. Soesjasji. At first hand Dr. Tachikawa and Mr. Soesjasji spoke 
    Japanese which I could not appreciate. As a European you cannot understand 
    one word of it. I felt left out and didn’t know how to react. I could feel 
    it was a very serious conversation though. What were they talking about? 
    About Hugo, or about the improved M-Stores? The moment I really felt 
    uncomfortable they’d probably realize they were not behaving correctly. They 
    switched over to English but were only discussing small talk. Now and then I 
    joined the conversation.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Mr. 
    Soesasji gave us a basket full of Japanese sushi. Kodjiro and I sat down on 
    a raked field of white small stones and were anxious to see what we had been 
    offered. Naturally we got an overdose of sushi! Glad we also discovered 
    small rice balls. They were all mine. These balls contained rice wrapped 
    into seaweed, then stuffed with a very sweet paste of beans in the middle. I 
    did like them. I took them all. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“This is absolutely 
    my favorite spot in this garden.”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    Kodjiro muttered overlooking the field with white raked gravel of at least 
    50 square meters. The small stones formed organic circles like rainbows. <i>
    “When I sit here for a while, I experience silence and emptiness. Serenity 
    is meditation caused by Zen.”</i> Kodjiro explained. That man and I were so 
    different from each other. Usually I try hard to avoid this sort of gravel 
    whenever I see it. It makes me nervous. I’m always a bit worried to admit 
    the feeling running through it, kicking those small stones into any 
    direction.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“Tell me now 
    Kodjiro, was it your valentine’s present?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    I thought I’d never dared asking. Kodjiro wiped off a small grain of rice 
    from his upper lip and said: <i>“No. I do like you. You are an intriguing 
    woman but I’m not in love with you. And if I was, I would not have sent you 
    a bouquet, I think.”</i> I was content. Strangely enough I was pleased 
    hearing that nothing was serious between me and Kodjiro. He was not in love 
    with me and suddenly I was not obsessed by the idea anymore. I accepted it 
    for what it was. Maybe this Zen-stuff had good influence on me.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    discovered another box between the sushi and the small balls of rice. 
    Kodjiro opened it. Three new M-Stores. He got a special sort of server out 
    of his pocket. <i>“I want to show you something. Okay?”</i> he asked. Wow, 
    right here on this spot in the Japanese garden! I always welcome another 
    upload, especially on such a beautiful location and with such good company! 
    Kodjiro put aside some of my hair to strip the bare spot on my skull. There 
    he installed the server. I could only see that he took an M-Store, the left 
    one, and then all of a sudden I was in a typical American drive-in 
    restaurant. I was sitting in front of myself! I was watching myself, staring 
    at a pasta-menu. Yes, with gorgonzola cheese, I am so fond of. But it was 
    not me, I looked at myself. I also had pasta decorated with small bits of 
    bacon. We talked to each other and ate our pasta. I felt attracted to the 
    woman opposite me. I felt attracted to myself! Very touching conversation 
    and tension was felt. I would like to pull her over the pasta towards me and 
    kiss her! I did not. We started giggling and I was talking about a…… mixer! 
    Oh! This is,... I am Jessica!</span></p>
