    There has been an extended review of my activities at Braintec. The team 
    seemed to be very satisfied. They appreciated my engagement with the company 
    very much and they want to keep me here as long as possible. I am too 
    valuable as the third human and the first woman with a MESI-implant, to be 
    sent home after the usual sessions. Therefore they offered me full 
    employment. Besides being a regular test subject I will also become an 
    assistant. The recruitment and guidance of new test subjects will be some of 
    my new tasks. Explaining the procedures, answering questions and being a 
    buddy for the newcomers. That sounds like fun. I have taken this opportunity 
    with both hands. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Starting next week new 
    test subjects will arrive regularly. To get a reliable report, it is very 
    important that a lot of people recall the same memories. Every week 
    approximately five new test subjects will arrive, they will stay in the 
    Research Center for one month unless they’re not suitable for the program. 
    To make room for twenty till thirty test subjects, they’ll have to share 
    rooms. These new test subjects shall have less freedom than I had. Dr. 
    Hamilton is afraid that he cannot overview their do’s and don’t when they 
    are with so many. Therefore these new test subjects won’t be allowed to 
    leave the Center without guidance. There is been made a tidying schedule to 
    get the maximum out of the test subjects. Almost every day is fully booked. 
    These new test subjects will have conspicuously less time off. I am glad 
    that my MESI-implant ordeals me a special treatment. I can keep my room for 
    myself and I can schedule my extractions and uploads in consultation.&nbsp;
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    am curious what kind of people I am going to guide next Monday. Will they 
    have nothing better to do than becoming a test subject, just like me some 
    weeks ago? Are they also thrilled to experience something extraordinary 
    while earning a nice amount of money in the meantime? </span></p>
