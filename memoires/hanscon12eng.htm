    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">In the 
    morning stand up early, we go to the Fuji! The train takes us out of town 
    through monotonies suburbs and monotonies industrial space. After that is 
    becomes beautiful. Through farmers grounds we drive into the mountains. 
    After the final station there is a bus heading for Fuji. Even at this common 
    week day several Japanese and some white persons go with the busses. A lot 
    of trees in bloom on our way. The Japanese spring is marvelous. We may not 
    enter the mountain. At the feet are temples from which there is a good view 
    at the mountain. Japanese are performing rituals in front of the temples. An 
    impressive sight. Here they sell several religious articles and souvenirs as 
    well. We don’t make a nice price this time. The same truck twice is very 
    unpredictable.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">In the train 
    back a fluently speaking Japanese tells us about the meaning of mount Fuji 
    for Japan. He invites us to go home with him. With Paul’s warning in our 
    mind we make an excuse. A pity, it might be a total innocent and nice 
    contact. The same is happening in the guesthouse. The artist who arrived 
    yesterday asks us to take a look inside his atelier. We refuse that as well, 
    it is not to be trusted. <br>
