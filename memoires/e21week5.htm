    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    think I made a mistake. The man sitting next to me in the plane a couple of 
    weeks ago appeared to be a public health inspector! Today he paid the 
    Research Center a visit to check on our permits and to inspect how things 
    are going nowadays.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I saw him talking to 
    Dr. Hamilton and I walked towards him. I had forgotten his name, but I can 
    recognize his troubled face out of a thousand people. I shook hands with him 
    and told him I was pleased that he made efforts to come and visit us to see 
    how things are developing here. How could I know that this man was not, as I 
    was hoping it would be, a new test subject to be? How could I know he came 
    by to investigate the whole business? Dr. Hamilton watched me with a nasty 
    look and ordered me to come to his office later that morning. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton yelled at 
    me<i>. “How could you have in mind sending the inspector’s visit to all of 
    us? Are you going mad? If you do not like it here, you better get the hell 
    out of here!”</i> I hadn’t the slightest idea why Dr. Hamilton accused me in 
    that way. It was obvious that there were big problems caused by me. Although 
    I didn’t know anything about the inspector’s visitors! I was flabbergasted. 
    I suddenly began to cry and couldn’t stop anymore. <i>“I know, I know!”</i> 
    I sniffed through my tears. <i>“I cannot do anything good! I am a shitty bag, 
    a total failure. Always have been!”</i> Dr. Hamilton’s anger exchanged into 
    irritation. He muttered something about giving me the benefit of the doubt 
    but he declared roughly that I will have to go next time I’m causing any 
    trouble. Still sniffing I reached my room. On my way I met Adrian, who asked 
    me what was going on, very worried indeed. I told him all about it and he 
    was searching for some comforting words. When he couldn’t find any, I 
    started crying again. Just one more stupidity and I can pack my bags. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">In 
    my room I comforted myself. Maybe it was wrong to tell that man, the other 
    day, openly and honestly about my epileptic attacks which bothered me during 
    the first weeks of my stay at Braintec. He asked me all about it and at that 
    moment I didn’t realize that he was part of the inspector’s visit. I thought 
    I could assure him to become a test subject as well!</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Later Steward told me 
    that the inspector had examined all the test subjects. In general everybody 
    was very positive. I didn’t have to answer questions. I already did in the 
    plane. I heard that Dr. Hamilton described me as an unpredictable, unstable 
    personality, being capable spreading around rumors. A typical Borderline 
    case. I don’t care at all. Fortunately Kathy had just left for home. As far 
    as Kathy is concerned we can be grateful to her we didn’t get into more 
    problems.</span></p>
