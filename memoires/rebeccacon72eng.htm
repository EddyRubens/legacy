	<span style="font-family:Arial">After we left Kaleb's door, we went to go 
	check out the new test subjects. I thought it was strange that the majority 
	of them were in Army, Navy, and Marine uniforms. It seemed like Braintec 
	went recruiting specifically for them. I couldn't help but wonder if this 
	was one of Dr. Tachikawa's twisted plans to learn military tactics or to 
	acquire information about some kind of weapon. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Carmen and I were talking about this on our 
	way back to our room. She mentioned along the way that she wasn't feeling so 
	good. I was hoping it was nothing more than the nauseous feeling your 
	supposed to get when your pregnant. I talked Carmen into laying down for a 
	while. We had enough time for her to get a nap before we had to leave. While 
	she rested, I decided to curl my hair so that I would look extra special for 
	Josh tonight. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Because I finished my hair sooner that I 
	planned, I decided to check my emails. I sat on my bed reading my mail when 
	I came across one sent from the name, 'UnknownSender.' I was leary to open 
	it, fearful that Dr. Tachikawa sent me something crude and horriable, much 
	like himself. I decided that I should open it in case it was something 
	important. It read as follows; <i>Rebecca, Please help! On the way to Japan 
	with Tachikawa. Plan is to take the long route. Contact with Kaleb went bad. 
	He is hurt. Unsure of his condition. Left him in Nova Scotia. Tachikawa 
	believes him to be dead. Please send him help. Overheard transfers. Nova 
	Scotia to Athens, Athens to Korea, Korea to Japan.Please find my father. 
	Send him information. He can help.<br>
	Megan</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">My heart was pounding and I felt like I was 
	going to throw up. I quickly emailed all this information to Megan's father. 
	It felt like I couldn't get my fingers to type fast enough. I only hoped 
	that he would receive my email in time to intercept Megan. And what about 
	Kaleb? How badly was he hurt? In my mind, I could think of nothing but the 
	worst. I didn't even know exactly where in Nova Scotia he could be. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I woke up Carmen and told her all that I 
	just read. I asked if she was feeling well enough to leave early to meet the 
	Agents. She agreed that would should leave sooner that planned. This could 
	change their entire plan of action. We grabbed what we needed and left the 
	facility as fast as we could without making a scene. We got to the car and 
	made our way to the Staybridge Suites.</span></p>
