    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Paul 
    was waiting for us like he promised and ran towards us as soon as we’d 
    landed. He gave us the injections immediately. <i>“Will we really wake up 
    after this near death experience?” </i>I asked while the fear was getting 
    heavy now. The nervous nod he served as a confirmation did nothing for my 
    confidence. No time for questions. Paul emptied the syringe without further 
    ado. I felt the liquid spreading through my body fast. For a moment I saw 
    everything through splintered glass and I shot up. Then everything went 
    black. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">A voice spoke to me. 
    It was a middle aged woman with a soft, kind voice. I couldn’t see her but I 
    could hear her talking. She put something moist against my forehead. I felt 
    safe. I was being taken care of. Slowly I started to make out colors and 
    shapes. I could understand what she was saying as she became less of a blur. 
    It was Sonja. She smiled at me. <i>“Welcome back, Rosanne,”</i> she said. <i>
    “It all went well.”</i> I tried to wish her success but found it hard to 
    speak. Not long after that I fell into a deep sleep. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“Is Sonja still 
    here?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> was the first thing I 
    asked when I awoke in the empty room. Jessica was sitting next to me. Nice 
    to see her again. <i>“Sonja has already taken off with the M-Stores,”</i> 
    she said kindly. Only then I thought of Adrian. I sat upright in an instant.
    <i>“Is </i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian alive?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    I called out. <i>“Listen,”</i> Jessica smiled. And yes, I heard his snoring 
    next to me. I was happy. I still had that feeling of harmony I’d had just 
    before the jump. All was well and peaceful. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Jessica was taking 
    my blood pressure. <i>“So you’re on the good side as well?”</i> I teased 
    her. <i>“Did you ever doubt it then?”</i> she teased back. Her eyes lit up 
    with pleasure and she made it obvious that she was happy to see me as well.
    <i>“Tomorrow afternoon we’ll be going to </i></span><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Portland,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    she said. So soon? It was all going rather fast all of a sudden. This 
    morning I left my hotel room, unsuspecting. Now it was night again and I had 
    experienced the strangest things. And in a few hours I’ll be on a plane to 
    Portland? </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian woke up 
    coughing. For a moment he looked around, confused, and then the words 
    flooded out of him. Still confused, he spoke about a tunnel and a bright 
    white light, the peace he felt and a dimension without time. I didn’t 
    understand much of it. Jessica was very interested. She encouraged him to 
    keep talking and so he went on passionately, talking about weightlessness, 
    colors that you could feel and smell in stead of seeing and the feeling of 
    being taken up into the atmosphere. <i>“Didn’t you experience it?”</i> he 
    asked when he started noticing I wasn’t following him. <i>“What was your 
    experience like then?”</i> I had to think deeply before I could answer that 
    question. I neither saw nor experienced anything. After the injection 
    everything turned black and stayed that way, until I woke up, feeling all 
    peaceful. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>“That’s possible,”</i> 
    Jessica explained, <i>“everybody has a different sort of near-death 
    experience. Apparently it’s your expectations that make the difference. </i>
    </span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian’s description is classic 
    but yours is just as common. Maybe you just don’t believe there’s something 
    beyond death?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> I wouldn’t know. 
    I had never considered it properly. I’ll see it when I get there. Or maybe I 
    won’t. <i>“But what will happen when someone has such an experience uploaded?”</i> 
    I wondered, thinking out loud. <i>“Those creeps will soon find out.”</i> 
    Jessica answered casually.</span></p>
