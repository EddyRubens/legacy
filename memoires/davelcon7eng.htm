    of the other patients.&nbsp; Lively debate about comic book heroes.&nbsp; Those silly 
    guys.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Anyway, some 
    interesting occurences of late, that I must write down.&nbsp; I have been eating 
    a new health mixture, a &quot;protein booster,&quot; as the good doctor has me on a 
    muscle-building regime.&nbsp; I am finally back to my ability to run eight to ten 
    miles every other day because of it.&nbsp; It consists of Thai food, mostly 
    peanut sauces, and some mangoe sauces, but some excellent Tiger Prawns and 
    tofu dishes with the extra enhanced addition of a protein supplement.&nbsp; 
    Truthfully, I think that it is more than just protein.&nbsp; I have added on 
    fifteen pounds of muscle over the last week.&nbsp; Is it a form of steroids?&nbsp; I 
    am not displeased with the result.&nbsp; I am trimmer, and healthier, and not so 
    prone to somberness since I started running.&nbsp; One thing that is different, 
    of course is my lack of sex drive.&nbsp; I was so incredibly attracted to several 
    females on the campus only a week ago, and now, I could care less about 
    their bodies (which are, from an objective point of view, quite beautiful).&nbsp; 
    Now I can only think of whether or not they are intelligent, and useful for 
    my M-store development.&nbsp; Finding that I am looking more to develop intimate 
    connections that &quot;nurture&quot; my M-store refinement, rather than just a quick 
    shag in the snow. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The secret M-stores 
    that Roseann has been giving me after she has finished with them have made 
    me see life in a special way, in a different way.&nbsp; Here is a classic example, 
    and this happened on Tuesday.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Roseann had given me 
    an M-store, and I poppped it in.&nbsp; Suddenly I was transported...is 
    transported the right word?&nbsp; It was more like I was already &quot;in&quot; a life that 
    involved me pushing a wheelbarrow and adding hunks of grass sod, pushing 
    them up to the top of a house on the Plains of Nebraska, and putting them 
    down.&nbsp; The vigour in my arms!&nbsp; The ruddiness of my cheeks, I could feel the 
    blood pushing to my face.&nbsp; My wife came out of the hut, her hands wrapped in 
    a swaddling of apron, scrubbing off the lye she was using to wash the baby's 
    knickers.&nbsp; She was singing a song, &quot;Auld Lang Syne,&quot; and was waving, after 
    she wiped her hands, to a trail of dust rising up in the horizon.&nbsp; It was 
    old Jacob, coming with the herd of cattle for our new ranch.&nbsp; I was thrilled, 
    starting something new, afraid, a little, in this vast expanse of American 
    frontier.&nbsp;</span></p>
