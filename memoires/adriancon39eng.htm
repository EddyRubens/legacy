    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Having arrived at the hotel I 
    realized I had made a serious error. I wanted to pay the taxi driver, and 
    that’s all I could do because my backpack with all my stuff in it was still 
    at dr. Tachikawa’s apartment. Just before I sent the taxi off I decided that 
    it would better to go to Kodjiro’s, and so I got back to the place that was 
    supposed to be avoided. I greeted the porter and quickly went upstairs. As I 
    was about to ring the bell I noticed the door was ajar. Might Kodjiro be 
    inside? </span><span style="font-family: Arial">Already? </span>
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">The last I had seen of him was 
    him taking care of Rosanne. Surely he couldn’t be back already? I pushed 
    open the door very slowly and looked into the hall. There was no one there. 
    I carefully slipped in and checked all the rooms. There was nobody there as 
    well. My backpack stood against his desk, not where I left it. When I took 
    off, it had been somewhere in a corner. A note was pinned to one of the 
    shoulder-straps. I opened it curiously. It was a letter from Kodjiro. </span>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Dear Adrian,</span></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">As 
    you know we’ve gotten ourselves into a hornets’ nest. Not only you and 
    Rosanne, but Sonja as well. I hope that Hans and Heather have found a safe 
    place. I don’t think we’ll be seeing each other again soon. I can probably 
    stay out of trouble myself, if everything goes my way. Paul Bentley can’t 
    help me, but he can help you. </span><span style="font-family: Arial">Trust 
    him! </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">As proof of our 
    friendship you will find a cheque, take this as compensation for all the 
    problems you’ve gotten into and for all your work. </span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">All 
    the best,</span><span style="font-family: Arial"><br>
    Kodjiro Tachikawa</span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I 
    couldn’t believe my eyes. He came back sooner than me and had already gone. 
    The cheque made a clear statement. It wasn’t a small amount. I decided that 
    somehow I had to get him the receipt for the case waiting at the UPC 
    warehouse. But how to go about that? Was he coming back here? I didn’t want 
    to take the risk of just leaving it here. Kodjiro, after all, was also on 
    the run. After one more look around I left the apartment carrying my 
    backpack and the letter. I decided to leave round the back to avoid the 
    porter. Just when I was coming out of the back entrance I saw Kodjiro 
    getting into a car no more than fifty meters off. I wanted to call out but 
    it was already too late. Tyres screeching, he raced around the corner and 
    out of sight. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I 
    couldn’t think of anything better than to go back to the hotel where I had 
    arrived an hour ago. I was tired and I couldn’t come up with anything 
    better. Maybe I would find Rosanne there. Or perhaps she was in the car with 
    Kodjiro? </span></p>
