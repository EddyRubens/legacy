    <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Hello, I am Kathy and I am 
    new on Braintec. I arrived last week and now I am almost completely 
    recovered from the operation. I am here because I find it all so interesting. 
    Those things only happen in the movies and so and when I had the opportunity 
    to experience that in real life I immediately agreed. You must immediately 
    comply for such things. I am very curious to the kind of memories I will 
    get. I already had a simple one, that was a balloon. But I am here for the 
    bigger things. I am looking forward to that. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">There were some real problems 
    a couple of days ago. There was a fight and I think they were fighting. But 
    I don’t know for sure. I am glad that I wasn’t involved. And that Adelle is 
    such a strange lady. She thinks the world belongs to her. Well, it doesn’t. 
    I have an aunt who is a bit the same. and I keep on reminding her. If I will 
    get one of her memories it might probably be a shaven poodle for which she 
    knitted a sweater. Really something for her. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">And I would love to hear my 
    dreams in sound as well. I don’t know if that is technically impossible 
    because I have an M.S.I. and not an M.E.S.I. That I must ask Adrian.</span></p>
