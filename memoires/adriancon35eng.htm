    <span style="font-family: Arial">There happened something strange with me 
    inside the dark hole. Rosanne and I were taking uploads as if our live 
    depended on it. Every memory was directly followed by a new one, streaming 
    through my mind. The box seemed to be bottomless. In the end I becàme a 
    monkey. It was great to jump around and to scream as if I lived in the 
    jungle. It was luck, that the apartment was almost completely empty. So 
    nothing could break by my jumping and running. I really must have behaved 
    like an animal. We no longer had feeling for time. Eating, sleeping, uploads 
    and playing monkey. It must have looked like that. I would love to review 
    myself in that hole. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I was just eating a 
    bit, when I heard the key inside the lock. It scared me the a lot. I quickly 
    dived into the side room and left the door ajar. A fellow walked to Rosanne 
    who was just lying peacefully on the ground, pretending to nurse a young 
    monkey. He reached out for her and turned her around. I sneaked out of my 
    shelter and crawled towards him. Every muscle in my body was stretched 
    itself. He curved above Rosanne and I was ready to attack him from the back 
    and slam his head against the wall in full power. At that moment he stood up 
    and saw me. I think I would have killed him if he didn’t show me his ID-card 
    so quickly. It was the man who arranged this apartment. Rosanne gestured he’s 
    okay. I relaxed a bit, while he told me this place wasn’t save anymore.
    </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">We had to leave. I 
    started to trill. My knees bowled double. It didn’t stop, I no longer had 
    control over my body. As in a dream I stumbled to my backpack and carefully 
    followed Rosanne. My body was recovering slowly, but I got very scared when 
    we came outside. Such a bright light and what an overcrowded mess on the 
    streets. It made me shrink completely. Rosanne walked in front of me and I 
    couldn’t think of something better than to follow her as a zombie. She 
    seemed to know the way, because we found a spot in a park, where we could 
    sit without being seen by other people. We didn’t say a word. I lied down 
    and fell asleep slowly while the sound of the city because less and less 
    important to me.</span></p>
