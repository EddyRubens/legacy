    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Because of the fight, 
    the atmosphere hasn’t particularly improved. As long as Dr. Hamilton and Dr. 
    Tachikawa aren’t together, things are not so bad. But when they have to work 
    in the same space, there is some real hostility in the air. </span></p>

    Adelle proposed to go to town and buy a cake. That seemed like a good idea 
    to me. Something as festive as a nice cake can produce wonders. We chose a 
    gigantic one with loads of whipped cream and tried to make up a reason for 
    getting it on the way back. Publication in the Scientific American magazine 
    somehow didn’t seem like a good excuse. Adelle then asked me if there are 
    some Dutch traditions that would work. A Thanksgiving celebration or some 
    Dutch equivalent. If necessary we could make something up. But I thought 
    some kind of jubilee might be a better reason for throwing this party. It’s 
    been three months, or so and so days since whatever happened. Lot’s of 
    possibilities. Once back at the Research Centre we got a calendar. The first 
    test subject (Dr. Steward) was operated on exactly four months ago, but that 
    seemed a more personal occasion that you wouldn’t celebrate with the entire 
    group. But then we found out that it was 6 months and 4 days ago that the 
    Braintec-team moved into the building. 6 months, sounds like a winner!
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton saw us 
    busy with the cake. <i>“Who’s birthday is it?”</i> he asked. <i>“Braintec’s!”</i> 
    Adelle said, displaying a massive grin. Dr. Hamilton looked a bit surprised.
    <i>&quot;It is about half a year ago that Braintec was established here wasn’t it?”</i> 
    Adelle sounded a little uncertain. Had we gotten this all wrong? Dr. 
    Hamilton thought for a second and then came to the conclusion that we 
    weren’t far off. His worried face turned cheerful all of a sudden. <i>“A 
    celebration! What a welcome suggestion.”</i> he said and left to get some 
    champagne. Not long after that we were all sitting around the table enjoying 
    cake and bubbles. Everyone seemed happy. Dr. Hamilton gave a short speech to 
    specifically express his gratitude to all team-members. <i>“And Tachikawa,”</i> 
    he continued, but then paused… everybody held their breath, <i>“Without 
    Tachikawa we would never have come this far.”</i> Dr. Tachikawa nodded in 
    confirmation and we were all relieved. We raised our glasses and started 
    getting into a party mood. The only one who wasn’t in a festive mood was 
    Steward. He was staring at his feet looking dazed. </span></p>
