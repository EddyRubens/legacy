    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial">I</span><span style="font-family: Arial">t 
    has been two days since my last entry and I have much to talk about. I just 
    got back from visiting Carmen. She is doing suprisingly well. The doctor 
    said that if she continues in such a manner, she will be taken out of the 
    observation room and released from the 'Left Wing' to our room. She was very 
    excited to hear that. I was too. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton 
    approached me the day before yesterday, when I was relaxing in the 
    communion-room with some of the other test subjects. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">He asked me to follow him to his 
    office because he had something he wanted to discus with me. Some of the 
    people I was sitting with looked rather confused as to why I was being 
    called away. Honestly, I was just as confused as they were. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">When we 
    reached his office he said he was going to make this quick. He shared with 
    me that though Dr. Tachikawa was a very respectable doctor, he was unsure of 
    his intentions. He said Tachikawa wanted to expand this research to&nbsp; benefit 
    the entertainment industry. <i>&quot;That's not what I'm about!&quot;</i> he said 
    firmly. <i>&quot;My purpose at Braintec is to find cures for some of the least 
    understood brain diseases.&quot;</i> I asked him why he felt the need to share 
    this with me. He said Dr. Tachikawa was interested in me. He said if he is 
    intending to use this company for entertainment purposes, who's to say 
    upload junkies won't get a rush from feeling fear! <i>&quot;Your the only one so 
    far, who can offer that level of fear on command.&quot;</i>&nbsp; As he showed me to 
    the door, he asked if I trusted him. When I said yes, he gave me a 
    reassuring smile. He said if Dr. Tachikawa asks me do any extraction's for 
    him, I am to tell him I need clearance from Dr. Hamilton first. I sure hope 
    I am not put in that sort of predicament! &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">After a 
    brief exam yesterday, I had to go see Sheila. I was not to happy to be there. 
    Sometimes I get the feeling she thinks she runs this place. I wanted to 
    confront her with the bitter feelings I had towards her, but decided to just 
    keep quite. Ever since she blew me off when I asked her about Carmen, I 
    really don't like her much! I think she picked up on my tension because she 
    asked if there was something I wanted to say to her. I just shook my head, 
    No. She said <i>&quot;You know, if you're unwilling to share, I might have to 
    deny you the privilege of getting a M-Store.&quot;</i> Deny me? Dr. Hamilton 
    makes those decisions, not her! So, she wants to play I thought, <i>&quot;Oh, so...your 
    the doctor now? You decide who gets what around here?&quot;</i> I replied. She 
    looked shocked and said <i>&quot;I don't like the attitude you came in with today.&quot;</i> 
    Attitude, huh? Well, if attitude she wants, attitude she'll get...and the 
    next thing I said was, <i>&quot;Oh really doctor...and how does that make you 
    feel?&quot;</i> I could tell her blood was boiling!&nbsp; She told me that she was 
    going to put this in my file, and then escorted me to the door.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">After I left 
    I decided that since Dr. Hamilton was upfront and honest with me I would 
    return the favor. I went to his office and told him everything that had 
    happened in Sheila's office. He just laughed. I think he was glad someone 
    finally put her in her place. The way I see it, she doesn't want to accept 
    the fact that she works for him. He said not to worry, I will be receiving 
    my first upload tomorrow! He assured me it will be something of a&nbsp; mild 
    nature but exciting nonetheless. I was so happy and so sad at the same time. 
    Carmen and I had planned to go through all this together. Now she would be 
    left behind while I am beginning the journey. No matter, I will keep her 
    updated and fill her in with all the details. I know she would do the same 
    for me.</span></p>
