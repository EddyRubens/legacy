    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Shortly after I fell 
    to the ground, the strobe lights went out and the door </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">opened. Dr. Hamilton and Sheila 
    ran in and carried me to the stretcher that was nearby. I was crying 
    uncontrollably. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Tachikawa 
    came over and removed the clip from my MESI. <i>&quot;That was fantastic! Very 
    Good!&quot;</i> he said. I couldn't believe that he was smiling ear to ear. 
    Finally, I found myself able to speak. <i>&quot; What the HELL was that?&quot;</i> I 
    yelled at Dr. Tachikawa. He turned to me with the most evil smile I had ever 
    seen and he said,<i>&quot;That, my young American, was an extraction!&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic">
    <a target="_top" href="e8link2.htm">find out about Rosanne's first 
    extraction</a></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I was shocked! 
    I just shook my head and started to cry again. It was against my will! No 
    one told me what was going to happen down there! I looked at Dr. Hamilton. 
    He couldn't even look me in the eyes. I got off the stretcher and went to 
    the door. I just wanted to go back to my room and lay down. There was 
    nothing I could do now, anyway! Dr. Tachikawa already got what he wanted. I 
    opened the door and Sheila said to me,<i>&quot;Will you please come and see me 
    tomorrow?&quot;</i> I looked at Dr. Hamilton, then at her and said, <i>&quot;I would 
    rather not!&quot;</i> Then I left. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">In the hall 
    upstairs I saw Megan. She was sitting outside Dr. Hamilton's office. <i>&quot;Oh, 
    My God! What happened to you?&quot;</i> she said with a worried look on her face. 
    I just started to cry. I told her not to go downstairs. <i>&quot;Bad things 
    happen down there! I will explain tomorrow in the Japanese Gardens!&quot;</i> She 
    shook her head as though she understood and gave my hand a squeeze of 
    encouragement. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I am now back 
    in my room. Though I am physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted I am 
    worried because Carmen is not here. She left a note which said she went to 
    get an early dinner so we can do some 'online investigating' tonight. I 
    don't think I have the energy for it. When she returns I will tell her
