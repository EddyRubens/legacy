    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Tomorrow Adelle will 
    get her first real upload. She already got the small pre-tests which pleased 
    her very much. Her experiences are very intensive so we can expect a lot 
    from it. She is very pleased about a new test subject with whom she gets 
    along quite often since her operation. His name is Davel and he really seems 
    a kind boy to me. He got his implant just one day later than Adelle. That’s 
    why their healing process is rather synchronized although it seems that the 
    operation had more impact on Davel. He keeps on talking about the images 
    appearing in front of him. Obviously I’m not a psychologist but in my 
    opinion they are images of long ago. Must be his own memories suddenly 
    appearing. Although it can also be caused by morphine. They are rather not 
    efficient with it here. This afternoon Davel has an interview with Lucas, 
    our new acquisition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Lucas is a weird person. He knows incredible much about the unconscious and 
    how we get along with memories. In his profession he deals with something 
    like Neuro Linguistic Programming. It is not clear to me yet whether they 
    took him here because of his knowledge or that he also is a test subject. 
    Maybe both. What I do know is that Dr. Tachikawa was dying to get him over 
    here. Adrian told me so. Lately he has been working with Dr. Tachikawa more 
    often now and does not mind keeping me informed. At least, I think so. Maybe 
    he thinks that I am complaining too much about Kodjiro. Then he should be 
    more perfectly clear to me.</span></p>
