    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I jumped out of bed 
    and got dressed quickly. Before making a fuss about this suspicion I must 
    know for certain. But how do I handle that. Let’s think. What do I need.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin-left: 18.0pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steward’s 
    M-stores are still lying in my car. The copies are there as well. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin-left: 18.0pt">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need a test subject with a MESI 
    implant, who wants to receive an upload of Steward’s collection, so I can 
    store the upload in images on my computer. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin-left: 18.0pt" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; margin-left: 18.0pt">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">3<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>And a network for the computing power. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">And it has to be 
    someone I can trust during these unsettled times. My choice is Adelle. She 
    is the only one who is anyhow supporting Hamilton. I just have to convince 
    her that she won’t tell the whole case to Hamilton yet, but waits till I 
    give her a sign. Otherwise my whole video project for Kodjiro would draw a 
    blank. Then Hamilton would take the rights and leaves Kodjiro and I with 
    empty hands. And that is not how it’s meant to be for now. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After dinner I decide 
    to search for Adelle. At my questions if I know where Rosanne is, I answer 
    everyone I walk into the same thing: <i>“No, I don’t, I went to bed after the 
    collision with Hamilton and felt asleep. It was two o’clock in the morning 
    you know, I had had it, I was deadly tired.” </i> </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Adelle was sitting in 
    the garden and I seated next to her. <i>“Okay, Adrian, tell me what’s on your 
    mind”</i> Remarking this she made it very easy for me but my story still 
    surprised me. She probably thought I’d start about Rosanne, but nothing 
    about that. I told her that Steward visited me and about my conjectures. 
    Adelle responded heavily shocked. <i>“Do you have any evidence for that?”</i> She 
    asked. <i>“Not yet, but you can help me with that, do you want to?” </i>She nodded 
    and asked how I would handle that. I told her about my device, but that it 
    was scarcely out of the egg. I also told her that it is better if Hamilton 
    doesn’t know about this yet, because I hadn’t sorted out yet what the 
    results would be for the whole Braintec project if Steward would leave. 
    <i>Steward is in it with a lot of money as well, isn’t he”</i>. She swallowed the 
    whole story and promised to keep her mouth shut. I explained to her that the 
    whole action had to take place during the night and Adelle suggested to do 
    it this night already. <i>“This evening Hamilton and Steward will go to some 
    kind of funding campaign somewhere in Texas. They shouldn’t be back before 
    tomorrow night.”</i> We agreed to meet each other at one o’clock in my lab.
