    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">At nine thirty I was 
    already waiting on this small bench. The plan I got yesterday, was leading 
    to a park which many young Japanese usually visit. More than half of the 
    visitors had bleached their hair. I was having great fun, while I was 
    watching these teenagers. They also were looking for a way to be themselves.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">At five minutes past 
    ten an old woman came to me. She didn’t speak, but she motioned me to follow 
    her. So I did. Three streets further down she went into a building. I was 
    following her rather insecure. It was an office building and together we 
    took the elevator. On the third floor she got out and pointed at a door left 
    open. Then she returned taking the elevator down. I got scared when I pushed 
    the door carefully. I had this inauspicious feeling. The room behind the 
    door was pretty dark. I couldn’t see before one’s face. That’s why I couldn’t 
    see the approaching arms suddenly grabbing me tight. Somebody pushed 
    something filthy into my face and soon afterwards I collapsed.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    woke up in a train compartment. There was this friendly looking man in front 
    of me. I think he was an American. The rest of the compartment was empty. <i>
    “I’m from the secret service,”</i> the man said. <i>“The FBI.”</i> He 
    showed me his pass. The photo was matching but I forgot to look at his name. 
    Outside fields of rice were passing by. For heaven’s sake where are we going 
    to? <i>“You are in great danger, Rosanne,”</i> the American continued. <i>
    “They want to murder you.”</i> Suddenly he caught my attention. Murder? Why 
    me? <i>“You cannot go back to your Japanese friend. He is not your friend. 
    Each day you stay longer unless strictly necessary, could be your last day. 
    From now on you’ll have to sleep somewhere else every night. These are the 
    keys of the apartment where you will be tonight. You have been there just a 
    while ago so you know how to find it. After that you’ll have to take care of 
    different sleeping places yourself. You can pay for everything with this 
    credit card.”&nbsp; </i>He gave me two keys attached to each other with a small 
    ring and also put a credit card on the small table. I put them in my pocket, 
    somehow insecure. <i>“Don’t trust anybody. Not even your own instinct.”</i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family:Arial">“How is that 
    possible?”</span></i><span style="font-family:Arial"> I asked. <i>“How can I 
    take decisions?”</i> For a moment my questions seemed to knock down the 
    American. <i>“Something is wrong with your head, dear Rosanne.”</i> I don’t 
    like it when people call me dear of beloved when I don’t even know them. <i>
    “Even we don’t know whether you could be trusted.”</i> This man was 
    irritating me. I was fed up by the whole situation<i>. “Oh, and what about 
    me? How will I know whether you can be trusted?” “You cannot,”</i> the 
    American answered quietly. <i>“You can only wish for it.”</i>&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I was sighing deeply 
    and looked outside, where, apart from rice-fields, I could see a building 
    now and again. I was tired. Wished I could fall asleep and wake up in 
    another reality. For instance at home, in </span>
    <span style="font-family:
  Arial">Holland</span><span style="font-family:Arial">. Maybe it was time to go 
    there. <i>“I advise you not to take any uploads anymore. Sooner or later you’ll 
    get one which is fatal.”</i> The American was talking continuously while I 
    was staring outside. <i>“Try to stay in </i></span><i>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">Japan anyway. As soon as you try and leave 
    the country they will definitely make an end to you. They think you are a 
    spy.”</span></i><span style="font-family:Arial"> The American gave me some 
    suggestions I could hardly remember. I had this bursting headache and the 
    only thing I wanted was sleep. After that he stood up. He got out of the 
    train but I could be seated for just a short while. At about half an hour 
    the train would arrive in Tokyo again. A spy? I don’t see the point. This 
    whole meeting was terribly confusing to me.</span></p>
