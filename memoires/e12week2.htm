    Braintec is almost over. His implant has been removed and when he’s fully 
    recovered from the operation he will go back home. But he doesn’t have much 
    to go back to. His wife has filed for divorce. He does want to leave though.
    <i>“It’s been long enough, my time is up.”</i> He said. <i>“Time to start a 
    new life.”</i>&nbsp;</b> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Maybe it’s time for me 
    to start something new too. But what? I’d better not think too much about 
    such things. It only makes me feel depressed. It bothers me that I don’t 
    know what I want. Even though the air has cleared, I feel less at home here 
    than ever. I think about the Netherlands a lot. My friends, family; I feel 
    like I’m really starting to miss them. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">This afternoon I was 
    talking about it with Sonja. It’s like I’m grabbing every chance to talk 
    about my home country. I think she understands my struggle because she asked 
    me if I wouldn’t prefer to go home as well. Just like Robbert. I couldn’t 
    honestly answer that question. How important is it to have a home? I’ve got 
    a place to myself here as well. And I like my little room here. It’s a nice 
    place where I can be myself. What more do you need a home for? Roots perhaps. 
    I haven’t seen my family and the surroundings where I grew up for such a 
    long time, maybe I need my roots affirmed. Just to remind myself where I’m 
    coming from.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial"> </span><font face="Arial"><span lang="NL">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
