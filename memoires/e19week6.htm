    Tonight I woke up sweating all over. I had a miscarriage. Three times. After 
    the third one I gave up. After that many difficult years went by before I 
    accepted that I would never try to have children anymore. I had to cry. So 
    much sorrow and pain but I came over it. I felt tired and went back to sleep 
    again.&nbsp; </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I gave Adelle a big 
    hug. She was surprised and gave me a hug too. When I told her I had enjoyed 
    her memory she wanted to know everything about it. She really enjoyed every 
    single bit of it. I wondered if I should tell her about the miscarriages. 
    She must have seen my doubt. She kept on asking why I did not tell her 
    everything, until I told her. She turned out pale and gave a sigh. I took 
    her hand and squeezed it. <i>“You are a beautiful woman,”</i> I told her. <i>
    “You give us so many good things. Thank you!”</i> A tear was running over 
    her cheek and short afterwards another showed up. When her eyes were soaking 
    wet, she immediately dried her eyes with a pink handkerchief. A deep sigh, a 
    smile and all her grief had disappeared. <i>“Come let us go and buy some 
    chocolate!”</i> she said and a few minutes later we were heading to the best 
    sweet shop in Portland. Adelle is a regular customer in this shop and knows 
    all the salesmen by name. We bought one pound of stuffed chocolates and 
    drove back. On my way back home I suddenly discovered that I had found out 
    something very intimate about Adelle. Something she’d probably never would 
    have shared with me. I asked her about it but she skipped the whole thing.
    <i>“It must have been good for a reason,”</i> she said. <i>“I’m rather 
    surprised that the information did show up through the upload.”</i> Yes, I 
    can imagine.&nbsp; </span><span lang="NL" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
