    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I have a much 
    diversified life here at Braintec. I peddle between the computer department 
    and the research center. The memories that they offered me the past weeks – 
    that’s the easiest way to describe them – varied between simple images and 
    complete stories. In the computer center I work at the DOSS (dream-on-script-scriber). 
    That’s the name I gave to the module that has to generate the printable 
    version of thoughts. The work is an extremely slow progress. But every time 
    I do get some results. The interpretation of the dreams into a text version 
    is getting possible, but it will take some time before we can run a workable 
    module. At this moment I have gotten to the point that the fact of the 
    existence of a dream that needs to be “translated” is accepted. An intro is 
    created on script, with a very brief description of the first images. As 
    soon as the image in the dream alters only the lightest, it starts all over 
    again. That’s of course not the way it’s meant to be. I wonder if it’s the 
    brief description that makes the machine see every small change as something 
    completely different. Or there might be a huge defect that turns every image 
    into a separated dream. I need more knowledge about the working of the chip 
    and the software around it.&nbsp; That takes me a lot of time in the library. All 
    the technical data, from the chip and the software, fills several 
    bookshelves. Too much for a couple of weeks studying, so I might be busy for 
    a while. It’s too hard to predict when my aha will come.</span></p>
