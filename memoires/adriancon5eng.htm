    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I knocked at Jessica’s door at half past ten, she came running down the corridor. <i>&quot;Good 
    that you’re already here&quot;</i> she said and the opened the door for both of us. 
    On her invitation I seated diagonally across from her, after she made a 
    quick cup of coffee for us both. <i>&quot;I don’t have any biscuits, but I hope you’ve 
    already had breakfast.&quot;. &quot;Before you start with your extraction, I would 
    like to ask you to concentrate on a happening, something that really 
    impressed you or that still impresses you, or something that you find very 
    nice. Think of something, that you’ve seen or been through many times&quot;.</i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I had to think of some 
    part of an air show I’ve seen twice. I stood at a save distance from the 
    runway, and a Russian MIG fighter jet came across at app. ten meter above 
    the ground. At full speed. It was really overwhelming. The machine screamed 
    passed me from right to left, to go up at the end of the lane and to 
    disappear in the zenith in a high arch. It reappeared as a very small spot 
    at the right of my visual field. Now it went much slower. The pilot pulled 
    up the nose of the plane at the beginning of the runway. The machine moved 
    forward at an angle of forty-five degrees with full engine power, but 
    excruciating slow, as if it stood on its tail. The pilot seems to be a 
    jockey on a cavorting horse. Fantastic, how someone can handle such a chunk 
    of technique, with so much power.&nbsp; That must be a tremendous kick, if you’re 
    allowed to play like that. Deafening but terrifyingly beautiful. And that, 
    while I have absolutely no affinity with weapons or war. But technique, jip. 
    According to this, Michael and I might have the same hobby</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After I had told 
    Jessica what I saw in front of me, she asked me to take a second thing in 
    mind. Now something that is more to do with myself, something I had 
    physically felt, with my own body. I thought immediately at se..., no HAVING 
    A SHOWER! Nothing is nicer than having a hot and very long shower. The hot 
    spout in my neck, at my back. As a massage. My muscles relax and defrost. As 
    if energy from outside flows into my body. Scrubbing with shampoo and bath 
    foam and completely clean and smooth and full of heat back on earth. The 
    almost-rebirth I would call it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I left Jessica’s room 
    for a short walk in the garden and to prepare myself for the coming 
    extraction. I am curious how that will be. Shall one of those memories or 
    perhaps both be given to someone else? How do they do that, how do they 
    select something like this from the outside? I must ask Tachikawa or prof 
    Hamilton.</span></p>
