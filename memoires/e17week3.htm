    Maybe I am too much stressed indeed. Nevertheless it had been a quiet day, 
    an extraction and so on, but before I fell asleep last night I experienced 
    something very strange. I heard voices. Not just voices like hearing them 
    when you find out something or passing some words through your head. Those 
    were strange voices and they seemed to come from deep down inside. If I was 
    to point at a spot, it would be right at the top of the back of my neck. The 
    voices were not talking loud. It rather seemed like buzzing. I could not 
    hear what they were talking about but they were talking clearly about me. 
    They were audience. I got very much afraid. What kind of voices were they? 
    They weren’t mine and I could not stop them or influence them. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Fortunately they 
    disappeared after a while. Also my fear became less. Unfortunately my nerves 
    remained, that’s why I could not sleep. Was I going mad? If the doctors knew 
    this, they would get out my MESI the same day. They took away Steward’s MESI 
    as well. Despite of his request they refused to put in a new one. I would 
    never ever like to miss any uploads. Hopefully these voices will not spoil 
    the party. I decided not to talk about this with somebody. That thought made 
    me feel lonely. Why I always had to decide by myself? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Restless I turned over 
    into circles in my bed. This should not last any longer. It was almost four 
    o’clock already and I still had not closed my eyes. Alarm was set on half 
    past seven. That still resulted in only another three and a half hours of 
    sleep during that night. And I had to make use of it. I did not manage to 
    become calmer. That’s why I took two pills Sheila had given me. It helped. I 
    felt asleep into a deep dreamless one. </span></p>
