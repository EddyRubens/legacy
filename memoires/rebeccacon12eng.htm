    <span style="font-family: Arial">On the way back to my room today, Rosanne 
    and the woman she was talking to the other day when the flowers arrived, 
    were walking around with this enormous card. (I found out her name is Sonja) 
    They were asking everyone to sign it. Sonja stopped me and told me to write 
    a message to someone named Robbert. I could tell Rosanne noticed that I was 
    a bit confused as to why I was signing a card for someone I didn't know, but 
    I was tired and wanted to just get some rest so I took the pen and signed. 
    Apparently this man to whom I was writing a message to, was having marital 
    problems. I just wrote: <i>&quot;Hope your future brings you much happiness. Good 
    luck with everything.&nbsp; Rebecca&quot;</i> As Sonja and Rosanne were walking away, 
    I started to think that that sounded like a wedding wish but O'well, this 
    Robbert guy doesn't know me.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <span style="font-family: Arial">When I got back into my room Carmen was 
    lying on her bed just smiling. I asked her why she was so happy and she said 
    she was done with her testing. Now all she has to do is wait to see what 
    they say. I wish I was done. I still have one more day to go.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">As I was lying on my bed unwinding from the 
    day Carmen asked if I had to sign the giant card. I told her I did and then 
    told her what I wrote. She laughed and said <i>&quot;If you think what you wrote 
    was bad, you should see what I wrote!&quot;</i> She told me she wrote; <i>
    &quot;Robbert, It's too bad we never knew each other. I am a woman who knows how 
    to treat a man! Call me sometime...Carmen </i>(then a phony number)<i>&quot;</i> 
    We laughed and then I told her that was horrible. I asked her to tell me 
    what she really wrote but she swears that was it. She so crazy! (But, in a 
    good way!) &nbsp;</span></p>
