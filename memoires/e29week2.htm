    Suddenly fun was over. I didn’t see him entering the room; suddenly he was 
    there and was shaking me all over. It took some time before I recognized him. 
    It was the man of the FBI who had given me the key of this obscure cave. We 
    came to the conclusion we had been in this dark cave for three days and 
    nights! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“And this, what’s 
    this?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> he shouted while he was 
    throwing a hand full of M-Stores across the room. I couldn’t imagine he had 
    never seen them before. Fortunately he managed to calm down. He explained we 
    should leave immediately. They were looking for us. Adrian looked at him 
    frightened. It felt as if he could attack him any moment. The man let go off 
    me right away and showed Adrian his pass. <i>“Bentley, Paul Bentley,”</i> he 
    said. <i>“I presume you are Adrian Young?”</i> Adrian nodded like a sheep. 
    He seemed to be back in reality. <i>“Pack the stuff you need as fast as you 
    can,”</i> Paul ordered. <i>“They can be here any time.”</i>&nbsp; I grabbed my 
    stuff as fast as I could. The M-Stores were lying all over the place on 
    dirty mattresses. <i>“Let go of it!”</i> Paul growled. <i>“You must be crazy 
    risking your life for a few second</i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">-hand 
    memories. You already had way too many. If you continue like that, I’m sure 
    at least one of you has no chance of surviving.”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial">
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrenaline had 
    taken control of me. Panic! We were in life’s danger and were surrounded by 
    walls! I didn’t know which way I had to run. <i>“Go outside!”</i> Paul 
    ordered and he was pushing us towards the direction of the door. <i>“And try 
    to make up something different apart from those stupid M</i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">-Stores 
    to kill your brain. Try bungee-jumping or something like that.” </span></i>
    </b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Confused we looked at 
    all the rush in the street. This was not what we wanted. I managed to find 
    the park instinctively, where the old woman picked me up last week. We sat 
    in the bushes all afternoon. In the evening we felt normal again. The 
    uploads had almost finished. We were hungry. I was longing to stretch my 
    legs and suggested having a meal. And besides I didn’t really fancy myself 
    staying in the bushes the whole night. We had to find a new place to sleep. 
    Adrian needed just a little bit more time before he felt human again to go 
    down town. He had hardly seen anything of Tokyo yet. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We were having a meal 
    in a small restaurant and were making up our minds where we should spend the 
    night. We made our choice fast. I still had the credit-card Paul gave to me 
    in the train. Hadn’t used it yet. We walked into the first hotel we saw and 
    checked in under a false name. What a relief sleeping in a normal bed and 
    using a Western toilet. Slowly I became completely human again. We now 
    longer had to pee into a hole in the ground.</span></p>
