    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Dr. Tachikawa had 
    brought all sorts of equipment from Japan. This morning during the meeting 
    he opened his brief-case. Two Japanese newspaper-cuttings about Braintec, 
    M-Stores and a small instrument. Adrian, Steward and a few other members of 
    the team who know all about techniques were getting impatient. ‘Coss they 
    couldn’t wait any longer for they all wanted to admire the instrument at the 
    same time. I couldn’t take my eyes off the M-Stores. They looked a bit 
    different. Another new model? I wonder if Japanese memories are included?</b>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Everybody was talking 
    against each other. Dr. Tachikawa had to answer six questions at the same 
    time. <i>“If everybody is willing to sit down again, I will explain 
    something,”</i> he hushed up. When each one of them was seated again, Dr. 
    Tachikawa explained that the instrument is able to scan brain-waves more 
    secure than any other measuring instrument. It has been developed by a 
    Japanese company of which I cannot remember the name right now. I think it 
    sounds like Sjoes or Sju. Anyway, this company definitely has shown serious 
    interest in Braintec and is suggesting cooperating. In order to support this 
    way of cooperation they offered us this proto-type. Dr. Tachikawa looked 
    proud and happy when he told us. He surely felt himself like a hero in need. 
    The idea that I found him very attractive in this way, was constantly on my 
    mind. He was enthusiastic in such a passionate way! He explained in a 
    dazzling way how we could approach cooperation with this company. If he is 
    right about his evaluations our know-how can redouble at once and we can 
    realize our dreams within one year. Everybody was inspired by his 
    enthusiastic explanation. He was a hero indeed.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Tachikawa 
    packed his stuff again. When he stored the strange M-Stores without any 
    explanation I couldn’t control my curiosity any longer. <i>“What about that 
    one, are those new M-Stores?”</i> Dr. Tachikawa couldn’t help laughing 
    hearing my questioning in such a greedy way. <i>“No. It is the same 
    technique in another form,”</i> he declared. <i>“Only different pictures on 
    it. In </i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">Japan they just adore 
    this.”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Everybody was 
    surprised when suddenly Dr. Hamilton stood up. <i>“I think it is a wise idea 
    when we have a talk in private,”</i> he said with his trembling voice. Dr. 
    Tachikawa nodded and suggested to go to Dr. Hamilton’s office. He walked 
    round the table following the director and turned to me when he passed in 
    front of me. He winked. Kodjiro winked at me! I’m sure of that; I saw it 
    with my own eyes. Again my tummy loaded with thousands of butterflies. Why 
    do I feel everything in such a sensitive way?&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Dr. 
    Tachikawa and Dr. Hamilton retired during half an hour in this luxurious 
    office. That morning I had nothing to do. Wished I could be with them, 
    hearing what they had to tell us. I was walking up and down the hall, tied 
    my shoelaces for the eighth time looking for other reasons to find an excuse 
    to be here. Sometimes I could hear them talking. I couldn’t clearly catch up 
    what they were saying but I understood their emotions right from the start. 
    It sounded very serious.&nbsp; Words changed into yelling. They got into a fight. 
    I was afraid they would hit each other and I nervously was looking for an 
    excuse to enter their room. Dr. Tachikawa left the room furiously. I walked 
    into another direction like nothing had happened. When I peeped through the 
    office-door I saw Dr. Hamilton standing in front of the window. The early 
    sun of spring lighted his worried face.</span></p>
