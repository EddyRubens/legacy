    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">We had great 
    fun in Portland. In those few days an enormous party had been organised. And 
    not just a party, but a wedding feast! Heather and Hans were getting 
    married! The whole place was done up in red and white. Everybody was in an 
    excellent mood.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Adelle 
    was terribly busy. She loved seeing the whole bunch together again, but had 
    little time to chat. A giant bouquet needed to be replaced to make room for 
    a couple of buffet tables that were being delivered. While dealing with that 
    she ordered a friendly looking boy to go out and buy some more cases of 
    wine. Even before she finished speaking, her cell-phone went off. I thought 
    it best to leave her to it.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I hardly 
    recognized my room. Adrian had safely put away my stuff when I left and the 
    room I came back to was as good as empty. It was strange. I fell to the bed 
    and even that felt weird. As if the thing no longer tolerated my presence. 
    The rest of the building seemed to have cast me out as well. The little 
    kitchen, the coffee-room where I had knocked the coffee-pot from Kodjiro’s 
    hands, the examination rooms, the soft drinks machines in that little hall 
    where Davel kissed me, <span style="color:black">the testing rooms </span>
    and the meeting room. Even Adrian’s computer cave seemed to depreciate my 
    presence. Have I spent all this time here? One thing was clear; I had 
    nothing more to do here. It was a good time, wouldn’t miss it for the world. 
    So many memories, old and new, I have experienced here. It’s all precious to 
    me, but it’s over now. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I believe 
    Adrian was going through the same thing as me. He was roaming through the 
    corridors just like me. </span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“It’s 
    over, isn’t it?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> </span>
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I asked. He nodded briefly. <i>
    “Time for new experiences.”</i> Arms linked we walked towards the hall where 
    Adelle was still busy arranging things. Sonja had arrived as well! We 
    quickly walked over to her. We hugged for a moment and Adrian confessed how 
    worried he had been about her. <i>“And so did I,”</i> said Paul, who’d 
    joined Sonja. Those two looked very much in love! The next couple to get 
    married? <i>“Make sure you catch Heather’s bouquet,”</i> I joked to Sonja.
    <i>“You may need it.”</i></span></p>
