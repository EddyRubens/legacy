    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We had a short 
    discussion of how the Agents wanted us to stay at Braintec a few more weeks 
    and do some 'reconnaissance.' They told us to try to avoid uploads by saying 
    we were sick or miss them and say we forgot. Supposedly, they needed to come 
    up with a new plan since hearing about Kaleb and Megan missing. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">We </span>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">never did get to hear the one they had 
    ready for us. Agent Andrews told Agent Jacobs to order us some food to go.&nbsp; 
    He quickly got up and went up to the woman with the reservation book and 
    placed his orders. Agent Andrews told us to call if anything got out of 
    hand. He said he would be in contact with me 'via email.' I get the 
    impression that Agent Andrews is the type of guy who like to use big words 
    and throw his weight around. You know, kinda drunk on his own power.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When our food arrived 
    the Agents shook our hands and said 'Good Luck.' Carmen and I left the 
    restaurant quietly together. I think we were both waiting to get in the car 
    and talk things out. We were both shocked and relieved to know our guys were 
    by our side. I asked Carmen how much she told Diego. She said she told him 
    everything except about the baby. <i>&quot;I told Diego I put on some weight 
    because I was so nervous about things that have been going on.&quot; </i>Carmen 
    said. <i>&quot;If anything were to happen to this baby, Diego would never be able 
    let it go.&quot;</i> When I asked her why, she said, <i>&quot;Diego's Mom was in a car 
    accident about two years ago. It was her and his two month old baby brother 
    in the car. His Mom was seriously injured but survived. The baby was not so 
    lucky. His family is still grieving their loss.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We went from subject 
    to subject on the drive home. We both basically felt the same about things. 
    When we arrived back at the facility it was pushing 8:00 p.m. We went back 
    to our room and flopped down on our beds. We were both starving and 
    exhausted. We ate our delicious 'meal to go' and went to bed. Tomorrow I 
    will try to contact Megan's family and let them know what is going on. Then 
    I will start asking around as to where Kaleb and Megan might be. Carmen says 
    she'll go talk to Jerry again. He always seems to have some sort of idea of 
    what is going on around here. I guess the long road ahead will be a bumpy 
    one. I don't know why I would </span>
