    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I felt terribly 
    restless the last couple of days. The schedule Dr. Hamilton made for me 
    continued as usual, but since I used the content of the box Dr. Tachikawa 
    sent me, I enjoy the extra animal-uploads. It is every time again a very 
    special experience. Most of the uploads are from chimpanzees in the wild. 
    Lovely. Those animals have nothing to worry. It relaxes me nicely……. wait, I 
    see…. Sometimes I’m a bit confused, but that is only shortly. It’s like I 
    suddenly fall back into the uploads they gave me. Then I have to stand up 
    and walk a bit. Feeling my own body for a while and then it is over. Every 
    day I go for a walk in the forest after dinner. A nice hike and enjoying the 
    rest. Halfway this walk I take an upload and I lie down at the waterfront of 
    a small stream. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton came to 
    me this afternoon after the extraction. He told me he wrote to Rosanne last 
    week. Just as I suggested him to do after our conversation. <i>“And”,</i> I 
    asked. <i>“What was her response?” “Nothing, nothing at all. I am starting 
    to worry.” </i>That was weird. Usually she responses quite quickly on 
    e-mails and such. He suddenly looked like one of the people behind the 
    fences…….Oh no, that was in an upload. <i>“Rosanne, yes, Tokyo, dr. 
    Tachikawa…&nbsp;bananas”</i>. I shake my head and stretched out. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><i>“Shall I go 
    searching for her?” </i>I suggested. <i>“Going to Tokyo to see if I can find 
    her.” “That’s a possibility to leave her easily.”</i> I suddenly thought. No 
    one would ask what I’m heading for this time. Everything officially arranged 
    with ‘The Big Boss’. <i>“I shall arrange a ticket for you”</i> dr. Hamilton 
    suddenly said. <i>“I find it a very good idea, I actually wanted to ask you 
    this.” “That is not necessary, I already have a ticket”</i> I wanted to say, 
    but I swallowed these words at the last moment. If he wants to pay, I don’t 
    mind. <i>“You know Adrian,”</i> said Hamilton. <i>“I feel responsible for 
    this whole community.” “I really hope you can find her quickly.”&nbsp; “I was 
    playing with this idea of searching for a while already, I miss her a bit.”</i> 
    I said. <i>“There is nobody who has occupied her position.” “I haven’t 
    appointed someone as a hostess on purpose, because she can do that the 
    best.” </i>Said dr. Hamilton. <i>“And I thought she would be back soon.” </i>
