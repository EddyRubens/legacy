    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Portland is my 
    destination. I found a website on the Internet of a company named Braintec 
    that does research on the reliving of memories. Very sophisticated. They use 
    some kind of implant to extract memories from the brain and to upload them 
    at a later point in time. I read their call for test subjects on the 
    Internet. They offer test subjects a free flight to their research center.
    </span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">To America. Everyting 
    was settled within one month. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I shall 
    be picked up personally from the airport and driven towards my new 
    residence: the Braintec </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">Research</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> Center. Test subjects 
    get their own room so they are interns in the research center. The minimal 
    stay is for one and a halve month. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">We shall see what’s beyond 
    that. </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Still six hours to go. 
    Including the short flight to Kangerlussuaq and the transfer at New York, I 
    am already traveling for 12 hours. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">But that doesn’t bother me. On 
    the contrary; it’s a release. </span><span style="font-family:
Arial">Especially the chaos at </span><span style="font-family:Arial">New York
    </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">Airport</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">, where all the people run around like ants, gave me a feeling I had to 
    miss for a long time. The massive, the anonymity, the rushing. All those 
    people who scatter around in all directions. I can comprehend the people 
    next to me, in front of me and behind me without effort. They chat about 
    their jobs, their children or about other insignificant subjects. I already 
    seem to be home, while I’ve still got one third of my journey ahead. I am 
    glad to leave </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Greenland</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">. Ilulissat is a nice place to be and the house is wonderful, but not 
    good enough to hold me any longer. The desolation, once a synonym for 
    freedom, weights heavily on me. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">
    Greenland is a perfect place to find your true self; there’s not much more 
    to see. </span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">The nature is 
    overwhelming and goes on for ever. But you will become insane if you stay 
    here too long. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I am very curious about 
    what will happen. First I’ll have to run through some tests. Maybe I’ll turn 
    out to be inappropriate as a test subject. In that case I’ll be dismissed 
    directly and able to go wherever I want to go. That’s something I’ll keep in 
    mind if the Research </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">Center</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> has a bad atmosphere. I can always try to fail for the tests. If the 
    test results are good enough, I’ll get an implant in my brains. What a wild 
    idea. A little thing in my head that transmits data towards my inner brains. 
    They’ll have to saw a little hole through my scull to place it. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">That idea gives me gouse 
    pimpels. In a pleasant manner. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I find it quit 
    thrilling to become a test subject. It will make me an important object for 
    their research. My human aspects will be send to the background. Though, my 
    personal experiences seem to be of great value as well. It is all so 
    exciting and I’m glad I’ve left Ilulissat. Greenland was absolutely a very 
    good place to be and I know for sure I’ll go back to there once more. But 
    for now I’ve stayed there too long. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Ah, the trolley with 
    the supper is almost at my row. I am looking forward to eat the chicken 
    that’s mentioned on the menu card. Chicken is very expensive in Greenland</span><span style="font-family:
