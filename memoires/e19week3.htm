    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    cannot remember how I got into bed. Was it a dream? Could it be real, the 
    experience with Kodjiro in the Japanese garden? Kodjiro gave me an upload 
    while sitting on this bench. Jessica’s memory! I can clearly remember how it 
    was. Usually dreams are not so clear. Jessica was in love with me. I was 
    looking at myself and I was in love with myself. That is very narcissistic!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">If that upload was 
    real, it meant that meanwhile Jessica also got an implant. How did she get 
    use of that? And where is she now? And why Kodjiro wanted me to experience 
    this memory again? So many questions, so many clues. The most mysterious 
    clue is the question how the hell I got into my bed. Even if the whole 
    upload is only but a dream. How can I end up in bed? Last thing I remember 
    is that Zen-period. Dr. Tachikawa and I were sitting on that bench talking 
    about the strength of simplicity. And now I’m lying here with a complete 
    chaos in my head! I cannot deal with that.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    was much too early in the morning, but still I had to find him. Chaos was 
    unbearable. He was not in his office. At last I found him behind his 
    computer in the laboratory. He turned around scared. <i>“Ah, Rosanne! It’s 
    you.”</i> Was he hiding something? He behaved in such a strange way. <i>
    “Talking about yesterday,”</i> I started. <i>“Did we really sit on that 
    bench together and did I really get Jessica’s upload from you?”</i> Dr. 
    Tachikawa laughed at me in a pleasant way. <i>“No, not at all.”</i> He waved 
    his hand like trying to push away a fly. <i>“I think you imagine the whole 
    thing?”</i> Dr. Tachikawa opened his eyes widely and looked at me 
    intensively. <i>“Yes, I thought so,”</i> I answered and stared at the floor. 
    Nobody should know. Strange things are happening here and I do not have a 
    clue. Dr. Tachikawa’s big eyes seem to acknowledge my experience. But what 
    happened after that upload? When Dr. Tachikawa and I were still in the 
    garden, it was half past five in the evening. I woke up at four in the night. 
    What happened meanwhile? I really don’t like it when I cannot understand the 
    situation. It frightens me. </span></p>
