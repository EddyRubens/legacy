    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial"><b>The 
    next morning I spoke to Adelle about this latest memory. She became very 
    quite and a bit depressed. When I asked her what was wrong, she told me that 
    she wonders why she has to wait so long for her operation. Hamilton had been 
    very enthusiastic when she proposed to come to Portland. And now she did 
    nothing but waiting for a couple of weeks already.</b> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">To 
    comfort her, we tried to find Jessica. Maybe she could tell her why she 
    wasn’t on the list for surgery yet. Regrettably, she wasn’t there. She went 
    out and nobody knew where to. I had some idea. It was late already, but 
    still suggested to go and find Jessica. We went to Elisa’s house. The woman 
    with the illegal café in town where I had been with Jessica before. I had 
    the suspicious feeling that we could find Jessica there. I rung the bell and 
    Elisa opened the door for us. She looked a bit shocked and said: “I suggest 
    you would take a look first, before you decide you wanna come in. Your 
    former girlfriend is here as well.” I asked her if she meant Jessica and 
    then we pointed from the hallway to a mirror with view to the interior of 
    her bar. From that hall you could watch straight into Jessica’s face through 
    the mirror. What I saw, was not only Jessica. Adelle and I looked 
    astonished. We would never suspect to see this. </span></p>

    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">We saw 
    Jessica and Tachikawa closely intertwined in a corner behind a table with 
    two glasses and a bottle of champagne on it. I could also see a map which I 
    recognised as an envelope for flight tickets from an Eastern flight company.

    <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Adelle 
    and I turned around, said goodbye to Elisa and went on for another pub. 
    “Well, you still haven’t got your implant, but you do experience the most 
    bizarre things here in Portland”, I said to Adelle. We both had a good laugh 
    which echoed through the deserted streets in the night. Suddenly we realised 
    that Rosanne is coming back next Friday. What to do with that?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We both 
    knew about her feeling for Tachikawa. This suddenly became an embarrassing 
    situation. I must tell her as soon as she is back. I don’t feel much for 
    walking around with secrets. And then Jessica, I had never thought to see 
    her like this with a man.</span></p>
