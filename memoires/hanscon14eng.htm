    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">After a tasty breakfast we go to the 
    temple. I have sealed the laptop to my body again to be able to send data. 
    Cloths on top of it and nobody knows. The journey goes smooth. We learn to 
    understand Japan more and more. At the temple side we search for a bench 
    where we can exchange information with the Brainteccers electronically 
    without being noticed, but in sight in case something goes wrong. </font>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Soon two Japanese and an American 
    arrive. The three of them introduce themselves as professor. The names must 
    be false, I think. They find the spot completely unsuitable. We say we want 
    to stay there. They show some equipment that needs to be connected to the 
    electric mains, they say. After some twists we agree with the terrace of a 
    cafe nearby. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Our group gets installed at a small 
    table. They place their equipment and plug it in the main. I glue the pods 
    to my body and then we connect my laptop to their equipment. Everything 
    seems to go fine. Suddenly four Japanese jump above and they place huge 
    screens between us and the other visitors. What seemed to be an open spot 
    suddenly became a closed room. We try to escape quickly. Heather managed to 
    run through the screens but I’m not getting far. Two Japanese hold me tight 
    and besides that I am still connected to the equipment with all those wires. 
    It doesn’t make sense to scream for help. There is a marriage going on 
    inside the temple where they hit huge Japanese drums. Outside I hear 
    screaming “Adrian, get them”. An American man enters and wildly hits all 
    surrounding him so the Japanese let me go in fear. Adrian takes my arm 
    wildly. I push against the wall. The Japanese equipment falls down with a 
    lot of noise. The electricity comes free and I see a lot of smoke. 
    Fortunately the wires break and I can run out with Adrian. Everyone escapes 
    in a hurry. Adrian runs after the Brainteccers. Heather pushes me behind a 
    stone. That stone is used by Japanese to bring offers to find happiness. So 
    it must bring us luck as well. </font></p>
