	<span style="font-family:Arial">Before my walk around the facility, I did a 
	quick check of my emails. I received a reply from Kaleb, still using the new 
	web address. His letter was full of information. It read:</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">&quot;Rebecca,<br>
	I completely understand your hesitation sending information via Internet. I 
	am, however, unable to return to Oregon to retrieve information from you. I 
	will be leaving within the hour to catch a flight to Rome, which transfers 
	to Athens. I received information as to which flights Tachikawa has 
	planned.&nbsp;My hope is that I can reach Megan before she gets to Japan. <br>
	I felt you should know I received an email from someone named Josh. He 
	mentioned that you were using his computer and failed to log off. Under your 
	name, he apparently came across the first letter I sent you. His letter 
	asked many questions of who I was and what connections we had. I offered 
	only the necessary information and told him to contact you for further 
	details. <br>
	I have asked my new partner Agent David D. Davis, whom I mentioned in the 
	last letter, to fly out to Oregon and arrange for you and Carmen to be taken 
	out of the facility. My Commander in Chief has arranged for all of us with a 
	MSI or MESI to fly to Sweden once everyone is safe and together. That is the 
	location of a team of highly honored and well known neurosurgeons who 
	specialize in complicated brain procedures. They are currently waiting our 
	arrival to safely remove our implants. They say the removal procedure is 99% 
	less hazardous than that of the implantation. They are guaranteeing a safe 
	and certain recovery for us all, even Carmen with her 'special ' situation.
	<br>
	I hope all of this is good news for you. Make sure you and Carmen are packed 
	and ready to go once Agent Davis arrives.&nbsp;I will meet with you and Carmen in 
	Maine when I have found Megan.<br>
	Agent Kaleb Desmond&quot;</span></p>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I was excited about the 
	news of finally being able to leave this place, but not excited about doing 
	it without Carmen.</span><p class="MsoNormal" align="right">
