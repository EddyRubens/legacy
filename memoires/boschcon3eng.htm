    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Day 3,&nbsp; 
    last night i have fantasised a lot, about everything that could happen if 
    you get an implant. I have been a filmfanat for many years already and 
    especially the science-fiction and horror attracts me. I have to think 
    immediately at movies like:the-matrix and johny mnemonic. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">Coincidence both with keannu reeves in the 
    leading role. The line between truth and fiction becomes very thin, because 
    we go to such a time area as well. Computers are built inside the body and 
    is used for the smuggle of information. My most favorite movie at this 
    moment is: THE-CELL with J-LO. In the leading part. </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">There she goes with the 
    help of computers inside the thoughts of a serial killer to try to find out 
    where his last victim is staying. She is still alive, the viewer knows, so 
    time is running. The movie is a true piece of art in my opinion. When you 
    see in what manner they filmed this movie, depending the camera angles or 
    scenes, that’s what i think is art. Al well but when she enters the world of 
    his thoughts all limits are gone. Because that man has such a sick mind you 
    can’t imagine. &nbsp;Now she has to go back in his memories to discover the place 
    where she is kept as a prisoner. It has a good ending but i am curious if it 
    might be possible in real life as well, that the memory implantation or the 
    downloading for another person, no other desires of fears underneath or 
    whatever else could go with it unnoticed that come up later. Wow that would 
    be heavy. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">I have been a 
    professional militarist from 1995 until july 1997. I have been the shooter 
    on a leopard 2 tank. Unbelievably cool it is to be able to deal with such 
    huge technology and to shoot. As a shooter you are also a replace tank 
    commander. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">So a bit of the 
    boss of the tank. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Okay but during a 
    war it depends on his death or mine. Yes well that is how it goes. You learn 
    several ways of survival and to kill when necessary. That way of thinking 
    and living is still my way of living, so who can say nothing will happen 
    with those memories if it will be brought upon another human being. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Who knows it would become a 
    killer!!. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">You see those things are on 
    my mind when i start thinking. </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">At this moment i am 
    listening to:joy division. Kinda depressing but from a transparent beauty.
    </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">I haven’t told braintec 
    about the thoughts i sometimes have, because it would be a terrible waste to 
    let me go as a test subject if i might say it myself. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">But well they must have come to that earlier 
    on to that possible mistakes. They have done so many years of research 
    earlier even before they have got permission to do this. So then i think, 
    well i don’t have to say anything at all. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">It takes another 12 
    days before i am allowed to go to the city center, well maybe tomorrow but 
    when that happens i must go home already. I have been a real die-hard THE 
    CURE fan for years and i would love to search for some real american cure 
    items. I adore them for 15 years already and i even have two tattoos of them 
    on my arm. So that might say enough. Their music helped me through many 
    difficult and also beautiful moments. Their music is of such beauty that i 
    seldom find in music. Their numbers are so divers that everyone can find 
    something in it. Short happy numbers and long slow built up pearls such 
    as:faith and at-night, the same deep water as you. Only the title is just 
    astonishing. I also never leave the house without their music, and now i 
    have a lot of them with me as well. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">So today the hypnosis 
    test it seems to be great i hope that they video tape it so that i can watch 
    it afterwards. I am going to have breakfast what is by the way totally 
    different than at ours, much fatter. And then they think it is strange that 
    everyone is fat over here. I keep it to the american cornflakes they have 
    ten times more choices of tastes than we have. I have never had a big 
    appetite. But well until tonight dearest diary</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">!!!.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
