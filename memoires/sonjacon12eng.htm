    <span style="font-family: Arial">Still quivering with emotions from my visit 
    at the monkey cellar beneath the bloodbank, I dialed the number I found in 
    the keeper’s breast pocket when I was at the station. Yes, the telephone 
    rung. It took a long time. Maybe it was a mobile phone and I would get a 
    voicemail message in a while. No, someone answered. “Paul speaking,&quot; a voice 
    said. I pretended to be a Japanese speaking English. <i>&quot;Who speaking please?&quot; 
    &quot;Paul. Paul Bentley,&quot;</i> the voice said. <i>&quot;Is it you Sonja?&quot;</i> Well, 
    that was a surprise. <i>&quot;Correct, but who the hell are you?&quot;</i> I answered 
    irritated. <i>&quot;Listen,&quot;</i> Paul whispered in a hurry, <i>&quot;I am a friend. 
    Your friend Rosanne isn’t well. She and some Adrian Young are heavily 
    addicted. At this moment they lay in some kind of opium dive using uploads 
    all the time – I’ll get them out soon, they are in danger. </i></span><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian also has the monkey-uploads, don’t 
    ask me how he’d got them, but they definitely have to stop using them. They 
    need to go to the Detox as soon as possible, because they are going into 
    cold turkey... They have Hans and Heather as well, two test subjects from 
    Portland. It is all classified, I can’t tell you more. Tomorrow you must 
    come to the old temple in the neighborhood east from the bloodbank, and then 
    we will speak further.”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> Then he 
    hung up.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">I wished I was home. In Brussels. With Hugo. 
    Even though he didn’t love me (anymore?). Then at least I would now what I’m 
    up to. Tokyo seemed to be empty. The neon lights were reflected in the wet 
    streets. The few people on the street seemed to move in slow-motion. They 
    looked at me, while they passed through. I felt terribly alone. After I 
    pulled myself together, I went further to eat something and then back to my 
    guesthouse. It was as if I hadn’t been there for ages. When I closed the 
    door behind me, I was overwhelmed by tiredness like I hadn’t had in years. I 
    drunk a glass of water at the sink, took a shower and made preparations to 
    go to sleep.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I switched on the small 
    light at my bedside table, and heard something falling on the ground. It 
    rolled underneath my bed. I bent down, and felt blindly in the dark on the 
    floor. There it was. A small tube. By the lamp I could read the script. 
    'M-Store X564C203' it said.</span></p>
