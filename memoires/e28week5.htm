    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Now 
    whom do I have to believe? If I cannot even rely on my own instinct! This 
    whole affair is becoming a nightmare I just cannot get awake from. I’ll have 
    to try and go through things and keep it that way. First of all using my 
    brains. I started rehearsing everything I got to know about Braintec during 
    the last months. Like jigsaw puzzle parts I was trying to form one complete 
    story. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">It was not easy. Too 
    much involved. And I thought I was dealing with a very solid company! Is 
    Kodjiro to be trusted? Maybe he has strange moods. Who doesn’t? I also have 
    been confronted with temper for some time. I wouldn’t be surprised if 
    meanwhile Kodjiro also has an implant. And then that fear of getting 
    murdered. Sonja was the first one to become paranoia, after that Hans and 
    Heather who have escaped. The FBI agent told me that they are also in Tokyo 
    by now. For the time being they don’t worry me too much. He advised me not 
    to get in touch with them. This would only get these innocent people in 
    great danger. He also advised me not to take any uploads. Actually that’s 
    the only thing I really need now. Reality is hard, too difficult. I wish I 
    could be somebody else for just a second. No worries going through my head. 
    Even if it is a monkey, I don’t mind at all!&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">While I was considering 
    my possibilities, Adrian called me on my mobile phone. He had just arrived 
    at Narita </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">Airport</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">. I was glad to hear his voice! He was talking very calm. Almost forgot 
    how warm his voice sounds. He suggested to make an appointment somewhere. Of 
    course! I explained how he could get a ticket from the slot machine and how 
    he could travel to the centre of </span><span style="font-family:Arial">
    Tokyo. We made an appointment in front of the Shinjuku station. Close to the 
    apartment of which I had received keys. I never had a chance to see the 
    place from inside but it should be large enough for two. And Adrian should 
    sleep anywhere anyhow.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Not 
    much later I saw Adrian getting off the metro. He looked around before he 
    saw me standing there. We devotedly waved at each other. It was not 
    comfortable with his rucksack and the rest of his luggage, but still we 
    hugged each other. All tension disappeared. Shall everything turn out right 
    again? Together we walked to the apartment which was almost empty inside. 
    Windows were hermetically sealed. There was a chair, a small table and in 
    another room there were tatami mats and a futon. We sat down for a while. I 
    had an urge to flea him. </span></p>
