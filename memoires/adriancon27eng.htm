    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Memories. It are things with a 
    very rare character. I was reading a book a while ago that sophisticatedly 
    explained the similarity between good and bad memories:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Good 
    memories are bad, because they are over. The moment of the good memory is 
    gone, done and over with; you can only miss them badly.</span></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Bad memories 
    are rather good because they are over. It has happened, it’s gone now, done 
    and over with; forget about them. Look further and go for it with a fresh 
    mind. Time for new things. </span></i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">That’s 
    how the urge for new uploads stays alive. It are always those “funny”, 
    “pretty”, “harmless”, “satisfying” experiences. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">While I’m 
    writing this I look out of the window every now and then and I see Adelle 
    and Steward walking across the park lane. Adelle has told me this morning 
    that she would go to town with Steward for a drink and a snack. She wants to 
    try hearing him out about his plans for the M-stores. I see them stepping 
    inside Adelle’s car. With her own car, then she has the control on her side. 
    She managed that well. It is still early in the evening, but I suddenly feel 
    very tired. I am going to lie down on my bed. A nice sleep and I’ll see if 
    I’ll do something or watch TV if I wake up this evening. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">The sound 
    of my telephone ringing woke me up. Two o’clock at night! Who the hell is 
    callin’? Heavenly, it was Rosanne! She has been at Kodjiro’s, seen Sonja and 
    spoken to Jessica. There was no end at her enthusiastic torrent of words. I 
    was completely overwhelmed by the stories she told me. She sounded a bit 
    confused, more than two hundred words per minute, but that was rather caused 
    by the amount of experiences and she hadn’t got a screw loose. I’ve seen 
    that before in her. She also had some necessary things to say about Hans and 
    Heather. A lot of little ducks have been swimming over by now. It must be 
    six in total if I’m not miscalculating. We discussed our doubts about 
    Braintec. I told her about being homesick for Elgin. That I was thinking 
    about going there. At the same moment I realised how I would love to see 
    Rosanne, as soon as possible. <i>“I miss that girl! Damned, what was I 
    supposed to do!”</i> I told her about the box of M-stores, that Tachikawa 
    had sent me, with the card and a ticket. Then it all cleared up. We both 
    wanted to go out in the sun enjoying an upload. She is coming to here; or I 
    am going to there. Elgin has to wait a bit longer. Suddenly our telephone 
    conversation broke off. <i>“Shall I call her back?”</i> I thought. <i>“No, 
    that is not necessary, the most important thing had already become clear.”</i></span></p>
