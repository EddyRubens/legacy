    Kodjiro kept his word. Jessica entered the apartment in a sophisticated way. 
    She was glad to see me, but not surprised. We kissed each other and she 
    asked me how I was doing. <i>“Do you ask me that as a psychologist or as a 
    friend?”</i> I replied. <i>“Or perhaps you’re just being polite?”</i> I 
    never understood why I was so hostile. Jessica stared her eyes out and 
    smiled. <i>“You are right. I’m fine.”</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Jessica had a suntan 
    in her face. When I got to know her, it was autumn. Spring’s sunshine makes 
    her look good. And she was dressed differently. Maybe she is happy just like 
    me not to be dressed so neat, as in Portland. Moreover she seemed to be calm.
    <i>“I almost decided to go and visit you in </i></span><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">San Francisco,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    I tried to draw her out, <i>“when I had to change flights on my way to here.”</i> 
    Jessica didn’t argue about it. A shame. Instead of doing so she started 
    asking me about all sorts of subjects and she really did great. It is not a 
    coincidence that Dr. Tachikawa had asked her and not that boring Sheila. She 
    asked me about my schizophrenic psychosis, ‘coss she had heard Kodjiro 
    talking about it. I told her that psychologists in Portland are not as good 
    as she is and that’s why I doubted the diagnosis. Bootlicking can never do 
    any harm. <i>“I would like to do some tests on you, if you do not mind,”</i> 
    she answered. I didn’t know whether I should agree on that request. <i>“Then 
    I’ll give you this upload afterwards,”</i> Kodjiro said and he putted an 
    M-Store type B on the table. You can persuade any child with candies, I 
    thought, and I agreed.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    test turned out to be long and intensive. We have been spending the whole 
    afternoon with it. <i>“Now it’s time for the upload!”</i> I proposed rather 
    relieved. I was glad the test was done and over with. I walked to the 
    bedroom with Dr. Tachikawa, while Jessica was reading through the results.
    <i>“I’m much more concerned about your addictions!”</i> she called at me 
    laughing. Kodjiro looked at me strangly when he was preparing the upload. I 
    didn’t know how to interpret his look. Was he horny because of me? What was 
    he up to? Couldn’t figure out any longer. The memory was already entering, 
    in no time. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was at the country 
    side. Somewhere in Japan. Behind the house there were fields of rice. The 
    sun was shining brightly. I almost had to close my eyes entirely in order to 
    see something. I have lived here all my life. I knew the hills in the 
    distance like the back of my hand. Years ago my father had planted those 
    willow-trees beside the house. I was staring into the distance. There, in 
    the shadow of the hill, there was a path. A man was walking across that path. 
    He was approaching me slowly. I loved that man, with all my heart. I 
    desperately hoped he would love me too, but at the same time I knew it was 
    impossible. He was busy doing other things. For months he had been gone and 
    left me in pain. The pain had gone, now that he was approaching me. He came 
    closer and closer. I was getting excited. It was him, I was sure, I could 
    figure from the way he was walking. When he finally had come closer, I could 
    see for myself. It was Kodjiro and he was laughing at me! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Jessica and Kodjiro were not there when I recovered from the upload. I was 
    confused. I couldn’t manage sorting out my emotions. I had no idea how I 
    felt or what I should think. It made me go crazy. Out of frustration I tore 
    my blouse into pieces with my teeth.</span></p>
