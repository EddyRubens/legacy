    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    return trip seems to be less tiring than the journey out. Maybe because I 
    travel along with time or something like that. I’ve got a transfer in New 
    York soon, so I’m not there yet. I’ve traveled the longest part already. 
    Sleep is not giving me a hard time. Instead of the joy which kept me awake 
    two weeks ago, I became tired to my satisfactory. I experienced many 
    impressions in Holland. Many good things to be remembered but also something 
    good to look forward to. Soon Kodjiro will pick me up from the airport! I 
    can hardly wait until that moment and I feel nervous when I think of him. 
    Again more tensions. I hope he likes the souvenir of Spottie. Shall we kiss 
    again?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">During this long 
    flight I started a conversation with the man next to me. He has been in 
    Germany for business and is heading home just like me. I told him about my 
    promotional work for Braintec and attracted his attention. He wanted to know 
    everything. I have never spoken to somebody who questioned me so 
    persistently. It almost resembled a police investigation. However, I have 
    answered his questions as friendly and patiently as possible. I have given 
    him a brochure and a pen when we arrived in New York.</span></p>
