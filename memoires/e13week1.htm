    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I 
    finished packing my bags yesterday. </span><span style="font-family: Arial">
    One small bag as hand luggage and one large bag to go as cargo. I sat 
    looking at those bags for a long time. Luggage is often too heavy and a real 
    burden to carry but at least it’s a positive confirmation of distances to be 
    crossed. Everything I need is in those bags. It’s so lovely to be traveling 
    again, even if it’s just for two weeks. Though I’m not really traveling, I’m 
    going home. But that’s nice too. </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Tachikawa brought 
    me to the airport. We were chatting all the way, which is exceptional, 
    because we usually don’t have so much to tell each other. I have to say I 
    was the only one talking though. The prospect of a long flight and the time 
    I’ll be spending home made me nervous. And when I’m nervous I become chatty. 
    Completely OTT and fanatic about the silliest things. For instance, I told 
    Dr. Tachikawa about the toothpaste I want to buy right when I arrive at 
    Schiphol airport. There’s aniseed flavored toothpaste in the Netherlands 
    which is the only brand I really like. And I told him about the time I got 
    terribly ill from drinking Pastis, an aniseed flavored French drink, and how 
    my stomach went in a cramp every time I brushed my teeth for about three 
    months after that. But that’s a long time ago; I can stand the flavor now. 
    All the way I was telling him nonsense like that, and he just nodded and 
    smiled. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We arrived too early 
    at the airport. After I swapped my big bag for a boarding pass, we had a 
    drink in a small café. We got along fine. Dr. Tachikawa told me not to 
    forget to bring back an appropriate souvenir for him. <i>‘No, no, I won’t 
    forget’</i> I promised him. Now it was his turn to share some silly 
    anecdotes. He started, I think, with something about a souvenir his first 
    wife once bought him and finally concluded with the story about a crockery 
    set that had been in his family for centuries. It may sound boring but we 
    actually had fun together. But then I realized it was high time to board. 
    The plane was to take off in ten minutes, with or without a passenger in 
    seat nr. 38C. I needed to move fast, so I quickly grabbed my coat and hand 
    luggage and sped toward the entrance. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><i>
    “Okay, see you then.”</i> Dr. Tachikawa said. He looked so sweet in his long 
    black coat. We exchanged a quick kiss. This was the moment I should have 
    turned around and pass the entrance with a quick last wave. But I stood 
    still. I looked deep in Dr. Tachikawa’s eyes and didn’t want to break loose. 
    If I could only take him with me. He gave me a questioning look. Then I 
    pressed my lips upon his mouth. He slowly opened to me and took me in his 
    arms. We kissed passionately. I wanted to have him, right on the floor of 
    this terminal, it didn’t matter to me. I pushed my hips against his pelvis 
    and felt how he longed for me as well. My holiday in the Netherlands, flight 
    712, all of that was far from my mind now. I was completely out of touch 
    with my surroundings. But Kodjiro did hear the last call. I had only three 
    minutes left. <i>“Go, Otemba, run!”</i> he said and firmly pushed me away 
    from himself. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The gate looked 
    deserted. There was one steward left who was just closing the door. <i>“No, 
    you can’t come on board, please take the next plane.”</i> he said. <i>
    “Please, please!”</i> All my stress and tangled emotions were being bundled 
    into one last pathetic plea. That and my whining about missing my 
    transatlantic connection were things he just could not ignore. The door was 
    opened again and the plane drove off before I had even found my seat.</span></p>
