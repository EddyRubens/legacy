    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">In 
    contrast to the soothing words I used to hear before we start an upload, I 
    had been warned this morning. The scheduled memory had a bad influence on a 
    previous test subject. I immediately knew what they were talking about: the 
    feeling of insignificancy which Adrian had after a memory with a rubber boat.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He had told me that 
    several days ago. It was a memory that didn’t do him any good. A memory of a 
    sailing-trip, he took with a couple of friends, over the Atlantic Ocean. It 
    was so calm that they became bored. The central figure in this memory goes 
    for a row in an inflatable boat and snoozes fast asleep. For Adrian it was a 
    bad experience to notice he might be drifting away too far from the sailing 
    boat which he kept on calling the mothership. He felt so awfully tidy, with 
    so much water and air around him. That evening we have talked about this 
    quite a long time ‘coss I have experienced something similar when I was in 
    Greenland. &nbsp;I have been hiking for several days in the widespread 
    snow-covered fields, which at the horizon smoothly changed into the air. I 
    felt a similar feeling of humbleness. But I found that tremendously 
    beautiful. Even though I was so small, I felt gigantic. An overwhelming, 
    fantastical huge world surrounded me and I was part of it. Like the white 
    landscape altered into the white air, my humbleness altered into the 
    gigantic forces of nature. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was right. This 
    memory was scheduled for today indeed. I was specifically asked if I dared 
    to upload it. <i>“Yes, of course! I would love to!”</i> My enthusiasm was rewarded. 
    For me, this turned out to be a very nice memory. Everything was so blue. 
    The air was blue, the ocean was blue. And because of the heat I was even 
    more absorbed by this serene atmosphere. My pores were completely opening to 
    dispose as much heat as possible. I had to sweat as well, when I rowed back 
    to the sailing boat. It’s a nice physical strain after a period of total 
    rest. I can fully appreciate the company of my friends, after this 
    reflection on myself. And I can fully appreciate a cup of tea. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    difference in the interpretation of this memory seems to be very individual. 
    For me, this sailing-boat was just a sailing-boat where my friends were. If 
    necessary, you could explain it as my connection to the civilization. But 
    definitely not a mothership. My mother figure was easier to find in nature 
    surrounding me. In the ocean, the blue sky and the warm air. I had the 
    feeling being save with my mother, instead of being afraid losing her.
