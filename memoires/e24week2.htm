    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">A 
    few days ago Adrian invited me to visit Elisa’s bar this coming Saturday. In 
    the beginning the idea frightened me still. For last time when I was there I 
    truly misbehaved as a result not being welcome anymore. According to Adrian 
    it’s not that bad. He apologized for me long ago and he supposed I’ll only 
    have to say I’m sorry in order to visit the place as often as I like.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Also Adrian suggested 
    taking another upload first so we’ll make sure we have a good time. I hadn’t 
    forgotten of course and this afternoon I asked him about it. He was quite 
    busy at that time and suggested to come back later that evening. Time went 
    slow. Finally evening arrived. I entered his office at a quarter past six. 
    He started laughing when he saw me at his door. <i>“I bet you cannot wait 
    any longer, right?”</i> Embarrassed I shook my head. Adrian closed down all 
    equipment. When he also switched off the lights and was waiting in the 
    doorway whether I would join him too, I had to ask him. <i>“Don’t you think 
    we should…., I thought we agreed on getting another….” “Yeah, yeah,”</i> 
    Adrian hushed. <i>“But not here, I hope? What happens if somebody discovers 
    what we’re doing? Besides I cannot make use of my equipment. The network 
    will get stuck and there might be a crash. And I’m sure they are going to 
    find us…”</i> Being satisfied now, I walked behind Adrian. He had managed to 
    get a portable set or whatever. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We got out of the car 
    near the river. We sat down on a wooden bench, close to the edge of the 
    water. The sun going down was shining on our faces. <i>“Which one do you 
    prefer?”</i> Adrian asked and he showed me nine or ten M-Stores appearing 
    like magic. I would rather take them all, I realized for a moment, but I 
    understood the choice was on me. <i>“What does it say?”</i> I asked. <i>“I 
    think you’ve tried all of them. Let me see what’s written on the list. Ah, 
    Lucas’ brother, somebody’s birthday, jetfighters, and I think this one is 
    that famous memory with the UFO. Don’t know what is on the others.”</i> 
    Difficult to make up my mind. My own UFO-memory was a great one, actually 
    also the brother of Lucas, and, oh well, actually all of them are fantastic. 
    In the end I chose one of the memories on the new type of M-Store not 
    knowing what was written on it. That was thrill-seeking. I started to count 
    off with the verse: eeny-meeny-miny-moo, catch a nigger by his toe, but made 
    my choice before the song was over.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian confirmed the 
    M-Store from the portable and placed it just above my ear. For a moment the 
    world looked different on me. It was already getting late in the evening. I 
    was sitting on a terrace, in dry summer-air, looking at the sky full of 
    stars. Adelle’s memory referring to her time with Frank! Again it was 
    overwhelming. Strangely enough, I seemed to get to know Frank just a little 
    better now. Undoubtedly he has a caring heart, but he can be so grumpy. He 
    doesn’t show any emotions and sometimes I wonder if he has them at all. I 
    really don’t like the idea that he works in the army. Who knows he has to 
    leave in wartime and then I’ll loose him forever. I’ll have to learn how to 
    enjoy moments spent with him more often.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><i>
    “And?”</i> Adrian asked. I got rid of Frank and looked at him amused. <i>
    “Again it was great!”</i> I answered. <i>“It was Adelle’s memory. She was 
    sitting in front of her old house watching the stars.”</i> I was surprised 
    how well I could feel humidity of the river into the sky. I could clearly 
    feel the contrast with dry air from Adelle’s memory. <i>“Let us go for 
    dinner,”</i> Adrian decided. <i>“What would you like to have?”</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Half an hour later we 
    were enjoying meals in an Indonesian restaurant. The Burma was delicious and 
    so was the red wine. We ordered our second bottle. We were in heaven.</span></p>
