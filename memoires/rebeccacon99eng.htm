	<span style="font-family:Arial">I read the letter Josh's Mom sent next. I 
	was curious as to why she was writing me. I have known her for years and she 
	was like a mother to me, but never in my wildest dreams would I imagine her 
	writing me. Not unless something was gravely wrong.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">&quot;Hi Rebecca Honey,<br>
	You are probably wondering why I am writing to you. Well, a few weeks ago 
	Josh came over for dinner and I asked him where you were. He said that you 
	were in Oregon doing some research for something. He never really said what 
	it was, but I suppose it's really none of my business. Anyhow, he spoke a 
	lot about you and told me that you mailed him and told him that you loved 
	him. Oh, I was so happy when he said that. You know, he has always had a big 
	crush on you. I was so upset when he dated that Darcy girl. Now, you know I 
	don't like to say bad things about people, but she is a no good tramp. Her 
	mother must cry herself to sleep every night thinking about how her daughter 
	turned out. That's why I am so glad he is with you now. Joshy told me that 
	he was going to fly out to see you. That was about a week ago. I hope the 
	reason he has not returned any of my messages is because he has asked you to 
	be a permanent part of our family, and the two of you are in a loving bliss. 
	I still remember when my Danny proposed to me. It was so romantic. Well, I 
	suppose I have taken up enough of your time. Please have Joshy call me as 
	soon as he gets a chance.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">Love to both of you,<br>
	Mama Mary&quot;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Well, I had to admit, it was a letter I 
	completely didn't expect.&nbsp; It made me smile, something I hadn't done in a 
	long time. Mama Mary was a true reflection home and everything that went 
	with it. Just her words made me miss everything I left to come here. My 
	house, my job, my dog, my Josh...my life! I didn't want to respond because I 
	didn't know what to say. 'Yes, Josh was here but, he's different now.' Or 
	how about, 'No...no ring, just lies.' I couldn't do it to her. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I would read Josh's letter and try to make 
	sense of what he's doing...of what he's thinking. My only fear is that he 
	and Diego might still be influenced by those bad Agents. What then? I 
	suppose I would be hearing the 'Tachikawa truth.' Yes, the truth according 
	to Dr. Tachikawa.</span></p>
