    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As I wrote in the 
    beginning, I study psychology. That’s where I would like to write about. 
    Because I have never experienced something like this. I read a lot about all 
    kinds of experiments during my study. For example, the research program 
    where subjects thought they were hurting other subjects. This is how that 
    went: the subjects had to test other subjects, who turned out to be 
    role-playing scientists. They thought they had to investigate how people 
    would perform under the stress of a physical treat. Every time this 
    pretending subject failed, they had to give him a pulse. At the beginning 
    they gave only a low voltage, but later on, when they were getting more 
    faulty answers, they had to give a higher pulse. They scientist who were 
    playing for subjects and who didn’t receive any pulses at all, screamed out 
    loud that it was hurting them so much and that they were worried for heart 
    failure. A professor encouraged the real subjects to continue giving pulses 
    and most of them did. That was this research about, to find out how far 
    people will go on a direct order. Only a few subjects refused. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Sometimes I have the 
    feeling that the Braintec program is about something else as well. That it’s 
    not about finding a cure for Alzheimer’s but about us. It wouldn’t surprise 
    me if it’s about our response to the memories. What else could be the reason 
    for so many questions and tests about our experiences? I often think that 
    they monitor everything I’m doing. They truly do, of course, but not as 
    intensive as I think. I think there are hidden cameras all over the place 
    and the real scientists are writing down all our movements. They made a good 
    story around it, I almost believed it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I am not getting 
    paranoia but I keep an eye on everything. Conversations and such are seen in 
    several ways. If someone asks me for my opinion on the Tachikawa case, I 
    make up several answers. Then I decide what the real scientist would like to 
    hear and I give them the opposite answer. I don’t know what I wish to gain 
    but it’s getting obsessive. I’m hardly spontaneous and they find it more and 
    more difficult to get a grip on me. That’s fine with me. I am more a complex 
    personality than they might think.</span></p>
