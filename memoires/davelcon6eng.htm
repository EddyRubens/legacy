    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I think that after my 
    talk with Roseanne, i am less afraid of dealing with my &quot;two minds&quot; and 
    eager to see a more communal reception in myself to the stories of others, 
    even others I have never met.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Which brings me to 
    this memory retrieval, which seems to be the fullest one yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had just 
    listend to the last of the B side of a Velvet Underground tape, and I was 
    shutting my eyes, when I began to remember that I was on a boat in Congo a 
    couple of years ago.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We were taking bend 
    after bend in the river, at night.&nbsp; The red eyes of crocodiles were blinking 
    and shining in the dusky middle distance.&nbsp; I was swinging a huge arc lantern 
    through the mangrove roots, looking for the ripples around the backs of 
    river dolphin.&nbsp; Suddenly we spotted on, a pinkish pearline river dolphin, a 
    female, hunting for prawns and yellow snapper in the estuary section of the 
    river.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">A man with a gun, a 
    tranquilizer dart fit into the barrel, took aim, and carefully, just as we 
    got close enough to shoot it and far enough away that we didn't disturb it, 
    he shot.&nbsp; We watched her flash and flare in the shallows, and then I jumped 
    into the black river.&nbsp; My goggles didn't help, my bare chest icy cold after 
    the retreat from the hot humid night.&nbsp; I kicked blindly and headed in the 
    direction I knew her to be in, trailing a rope and a holding net with me.&nbsp;
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I found her, just 
    meagerly flapping, and then draped a cotton face veil over her eyes, wetted 
    h er down, and slipped the net under her flippers, to drag her slowly and 
    carefully back to the paddle boat.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><img border="0" src="images/riverdolphin.jpg" width="300" height="197"></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">And then the night 
    ended, and i was awake, staring out of my window at the gardener pruning the 
    ash trees back.&nbsp; Spring was coming in a couple of months, and he must have 
    been preparing the old branches for the new buds.</span></p>
