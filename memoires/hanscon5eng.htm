    <span style="font-family: Arial">Phew, escaped.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Heather came in the 
    evening before yesterday saying that she can’t trust it anymore. Parts of 
    the building are hermetically sealed. She saw people coming out of there who 
    looked like zombies and who were driven away in a van. She can’t find her 
    focal point. I let her read Sonja’s e-mail and say that I haven’t seen my 
    contact person, Rosanne, either. Shall we go find them? It seems better not 
    to do that because the focal point might be part of the complot. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">It’s better to 
    escape, but how? Heather had spoken to the Japanese, but they keep on 
    finding everything ‘great’. We have to do it with the two of us. It is short 
    day. Tomorrow morning we’ll have the operation and the building is heavily 
    secured. We decide to do the following. We let them know that we insist 
    having the MESI-implant. That has two plus-points. We will be operated after 
    the Japanese and have more time. Then the allowances we are able to withdraw 
    are higher and we need a lot of money to get far from here. And we must 
    prevent not to get drugged. It seems to be the best to avoid injections and 
    to get rid of the pills they give us. If everything is red-white here the 
    pills might be as well and we can change them for the candies at the 
    reception. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The psychologist 
    enters, together with the research leader. Two people at one room aren’t 
    allowed before the operation, they say sternly. We need to rest. We say that 
    we were discussing the MESI-implant, and that the result is positive. Then 
    the faces brightened up. I will be operated after the Japanese and then 
    Heather. Before the operation a small laptop is sealed on our bodies to 
    registrate all activities during the next weeks. Now we must go to sleep 
    soon. We have our plan ready. I give all my things to Heather who puts them 
    under her clothes when she gets back to her room. Yesterday morning we 
    withdraw as much money as possible and I took candies with me while Haether 
    was talking to the receptionist. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial">They lay me on an</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"> 
    operation table and am driven towards the operation chamber. I see one of 
    the Japanese lying under the huge lamps. I say that I don’t want any 
    injections and then a nurse comes with some indeed red and white pills. I 
    pretend getting sleepy. The attention goes to the Japanese now. A lot of 
    devices on high voltage. I make use of that. I know how to create 
    short-circuit in a high voltage circuit. A huge bam and a lot of smoke 
    follows. I creep away from under the sheets and walk into the corridor. 
    Heather stands ready with clothes. We walk quietly to the exit. The 
    receptionist panics because the electricity was down. We say that the 
    sliding doors will go open with a hard push. We will demonstrate that 
    because we want to have a walk. The gate outside is locked through the power 
    failure as well. To the porter I say that I have permission to go out for a 
    walk just like the day before yesterday. He sees that I have just had 
    surgery because my bondage and taped laptop. Heather asks him if he wants to 
    help us climbing over the gate now the power went down. He even does it. 
    With a push of the porter we climb over the gate and wave to the porter. The 
    psychological tests are remarkably good according to Heather’s resistant to 
    stress. She stays unnatural calm, what helps me to stay relaxed as well.</span></p>
