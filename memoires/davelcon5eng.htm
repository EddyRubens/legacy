    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Stayed up until three 
    a.m. talking to Roseanne, smoking cigarettes, which I have never smoked.&nbsp; I 
    told myself never to stop,but the stress has been classified as &quot;smoke 
    alert&quot; in my book, so I've taken to them.&nbsp; And the fact that Roseanne is one 
    of the most amazing conversationalists and thinkers I've come across is not 
    a small part in my reasoning to stay up late and ask question after question 
    about her long and experimental journey at Braintec.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I'm not sure what all 
    she said, but I do remember some very interesting tidbits.&nbsp; Like, she was 
    found on the ferry from Vancouver, and that's partially the reason that she 
    stayed at Braintec.&nbsp; It started out as a friendly invitation, but then she 
    soon realized the scientific importance, and, like a soldier or a missionary 
    answering the call to a higher duty, she enveloped herself in the process.&nbsp;
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It's amazing that a 
    woman of such beauty and intelligence, and so young, would fight the 
    passions that she must have for other things in life, and still dedicate 
    herself to such an ambiguous, but exciting project.&nbsp; I feel safer knowing 
    that I've made the right decision. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We talked most of 
    thenight about these &quot;hallucinations&quot; that I've been having, and we came to 
    a startling conclusion.&nbsp; It must result from my failure to accept the 
    process.&nbsp; The memory cache that I am supposed to be building is fragmented, 
    simply because I am too shocked and unwilling to &quot;give myself up&quot; to the 
    process of memoric organic growth.&nbsp; I think that's how it is written in the 
    pamphlets and white papers of the science foundation.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">My dual memory and &quot;othered 
    literary narrative process&quot; must come to me, whether I want it to or not, 
    when it comes.&nbsp; When it does come, I am supposed to be recieving it as an 
    act of concentration and release, but up until now I have been trying to run 
    away from the differing perceptions of the world, as received through the 
    mind chip. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">With that 
    conversation I walked home, taking the long way, walking all the way up the 
    Broad street to the Milly Tavern, seeing it was closed, walking a little 
    further, and cutting across the Mayor's lawn to get home to my apartment off 
    campus.&nbsp; I asked for the apartment off campus, because I am a recluse and 
    afraid of people.</span></p>
