    disappointed when I could only tell them some small details about Matthew 
    and Nancy the next morning. All I remembered were the things I’d already 
    told them right after the upload. There was no connection to the information 
    left; I had no longer the feeling that I knew this Matthew and Nancy. They 
    became characters from a book or a movie. That was a relief for me, ‘coss I 
    find the idea of knowing people whom I don’t know at all quite confusing. 
    What if I would ever meet them on the street? Dr. Hamilton had to deal with 
    the biggest disappointment of all while Dr. Tachikawa had already suspected 
    this. The memories were only stored in my short-time memory, he explained. 
    Only the real important information will be stored for a longer time.</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial"><b>&nbsp;</b> </span>
