    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    received a postcard with a special message from Dr. Tachikawa! A plane 
    ticket to Tokyo! Reading on the postcard: <i>“You’re welcome to join us 
    whenever you wish, reg. K. Tachikawa”</i>.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">While I was walking 
    through the building indifferently, Steve contacted me. <i>“There’s a letter 
    for you. Registered, so you’ll have to sign for delivery.”</i> I walked with 
    him, as fast as I could, to the postman waiting for me patiently. I like 
    receiving mail. Especially when I have to sign for it. In that case it is 
    something special. <i>“And?”</i> Steve asked. <i>“Something special?”</i> 
    When I saw the envelop and the plane ticket I couldn’t imagine anything more 
    exciting. Kodjiro loves me, I thought for a moment, but then immediately I 
    skipped the idea about that. Instinctively I was hiding the ticket for Steve.
    <i>“It’s a postcard,”</i> I said. <i>“A good friend of mine.”</i> I directly 
    ran to my room to examine the contents of the card. Actually the card is a 
    bit weird. Tourist stuff. But the words on it are all that matters. No date 
    written on the ticket. I found a telephone number requesting contact within 
    three months to confirm a definite booking. Fantastic! This mail is surely 
    something special.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    was thrilled. Nobody ever has sent me a plane ticket just like that. Okay, 
    Braintec obviously, paid for my flight from Greenland to Portland, but that’s 
    for business. If Kodjiro sends me something expensive like this here, I’m 
    positive he likes me very much. Anyhow he wants to see me! Makes me feel so 
    happy!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was excited all day 
    long. A few times somebody asked me why I looked so happy. I decided not to 
    tell anyone about it. Dr. Tachikawa probably has another good reason why he 
    prefers to have me around. This reason will only turn into a fight when they 
    find out. Pronouncing his name already has created a taboo. I don’t mind 
    sharing the great news with somebody. In the past I have said something 
    casually. I did to Sally and much later also to Adelle. She exactly knows 
    when something important is happening to me and then she questions me too 
    much. I haven’t told them a bit. I’d rather keep it for myself for a while 
    as long as I haven’t decided what to do with this ticket.</span></p>
