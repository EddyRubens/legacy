    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I am 
    almost entirely recovered, and Nursie’s message made me alert. I constantly 
    feel the urge to scratch but despite my expectations the wound has healed 
    very quickly. (they have to open it again of course).&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I also 
    had my first upload. They told me it would be a UFO experience, but.... I 
    only saw some vague spots and I noticed that the sound was really weird. As 
    if they played a tape backwards. A bit like that Pink floyd track on Wish 
    you were here. Rosanne seems to be disappointed that I can’t share her 
    thoughts about the UFO.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">A nice 
    conversation with Sonia. She thinks Rosanne’s search for the sender of the 
    valentine bouquet is rather daft. I’ve got the impression she likes the 
    romance more than the concrete part of knowing who. And I join her in that. 
    What is more alluring than to fantasize about a secret lover. For someone 
    who searches it is more valuable than to find out. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Then I 
    have to decide which memory I want them to up-load... (giggle) there are 
    some that would definitely be appreciated by the male, but I guess the 
    ladies won’t be that charmed.... so I choose for my trip to the Mount 
    Everest. Not the whole tour of course (took 26 days) but the moment that I 
    reached the top of a mountain track and could see the famous mountain itself 
    for the first time. The combination of deadly tiredness, hunger, out of 
    breath and the overwhelming view at the same time. I hope this transfer can 
    bear such emotions. Or should they be only images?</span></p>
