    Never ever saw Dr. Tachikawa so irritated. It’s obvious, seeing me here in 
    this building was not what he wanted. A few seconds later we joined the 
    table with three men I’ve never seen before. Jessica entered the room with a 
    tray loaded with tea and small snacks. Obviously this was the Japanese 
    delegation of Braintec. If Kodjiro didn’t lie to me about the fact that 
    there weren’t more than ten people in the whole of Japan knowing what 
    Braintec was really about, then this must be the hard core. Thrilling.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">A grumpy looking man 
    stood up and said something in Japanese while he wasn’t an Asian himself. 
    Everybody was nodding and I did the same. Then he switched over into English, 
    fortunately. He told us about a couple of test subjects arriving to Tokyo 
    yesterday, coming from Portland. He meant Heather and Hans, an American 
    woman and a Dutch man. According to the network they would be here for a 
    special upload, that’s what he said. But according to our information the 
    ins and outs of the matter were completely different. He looked thoroughly 
    at the man to the right. I hadn’t met him before either. <i>“It’s a trick,”</i> 
    this man answered in an amazing high voice. <i>“He’s been framed. It must be 
    the NPI and the FBI dealing with this. We should operate very accurately.”</i> 
    There was a buzz. The man, who spoke before, apparently the leader of this 
    group, hit the table with his fist. <i>“We shouldn’t let them know that we 
    got it, no way!”</i> he yelled. He scared me a bit<i>. “Let us take the bait 
    and then pull them towards us.”</i> Again everybody was misunderstanding 
    each other. The man in charge didn’t mind this time. He stood up, bent 
    forward and walked out of the door.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Didn’t 
    know what I should feel or think. Hans and Heather could have a real problem. 
    But I had too little information to find out in what way they are in 
    terribly danger. I wanted to talk to Jessica. She might give me a clear 
    picture. I looked around me, but I couldn’t find Jessica anywhere. No idea 
    where she had gone so quickly. Dr. Tachikawa grabbed me by the arm and 
    almost dragged me outside. He looked at me seriously in the elevator. <i>
    “From the beginning I have tried to protect you and kept you out of it,” </i>
    he said snappy. <i>“Now you are on your own.”</i>&nbsp; </span></p>
