    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I sat on the couch in Josh and Diego's suite 
	staring down at my blood soaked shirt and jeans. Josh came and sat beside 
	me. He put his arms around me and assured me that everything would be OK 
	soon. <i>&quot;Carmen is getting excellent help and Diego is there with her. 
	Nothing bad is going to happen anymore.&quot;</i>&nbsp; I wanted to believe him. 
	But my gut feeling told me this still was long from being over. If Carmen 
	was OK, what about Megan and Kaleb? Would they be taken care of or forgotten 
	about?</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Josh interrupted my thoughts when he told me 
	I should go take a shower. <i>&quot;I have some clothes you can wear back to the 
	facility.&quot; &quot;What do you mean, back to the facility?&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;Well, 
	the agents said they think it would be best if you went back. The doctors 
	might wonder where you are.&quot;</i> He replied. <i>&quot;But Josh,&quot;</i> I said, <i>
	&quot;Don't you think they are going to wonder where Carmen is? They know we go 
	everywhere together. They'll start asking all kinds of 
	questions...and...NO!...I don't want to go back!&quot;</i> I knew Josh was trying 
	to stay calm. From the look in his eyes, I don't think he wanted me to go 
	back either. <i>&quot;OK...listen,&quot;</i> he said, <i>&quot;I am going to talk to the 
	agents to see if you can stay here with me for the night. That way we'll be 
	able to figure out a story for you to tell the people at Braintec.&quot;</i> I 
	paused for a minute then said, <i>&quot;OK.&quot;</i> </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Josh went into the bathroom and started the 
	shower up. I still sat on the couch glazing around the room. Through my 
	stares, my eyes caught hold of Josh's computer. I wanted to check my email 
	even more than ever. My mind was exploding with anticipation to see if Mr. 
	Isakova returned a message. And what about Megan? I think I am the last hope 
	she has. I planned to get online once Josh left to talk to the agents. So 
	much was going through my head that it was hard to focus. I was, however, 
	able to make my mind up about one thing. If Mr. Isakova returned a letter to 
	me, I decided he would be the one reliable source I could depend on. These 
	agents didn't seem to care much about the people I cared for. I doubted them 
	from the beginning and the feeling grew more with every contact we had. 
	Their professionalism and conduct was not what I expected from agents of the 
	United States. They seemed unorganized, discursive, and even apathetic to 
	the whereabouts of a fellow agent in distress. And, why is it that they 
	couldn't seem to get simple things to work, like the phone line, for 
	example.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Once again my deep thoughts were interrupted.
	<i>&quot;The water is nice and hot!&quot;</i> Josh said as he walked towards me. I 
	stood up and did my best to crack a smile. As he stood in front of me, he 
	placed his hands below each of my ears. He pulled my head towards his and 
	kissed my forehead. When we parted, I looked into his eyes and was lost in 
	emotion. It was another moment I wanted to last forever. He smiled and 
	motioned with his head to go to the shower. I walked toward the bathroom. I 
	had to first go through the bedroom where Carmen had been a short time ago. 
	Josh must have ripped all the blankets and sheets of the bed. There was just 
	the naked mattress with a pair of his sweatpants, and a T-shirt lying on it. 
	I went into the bathroom and stuck my hand in the streams of shower water. 
	It was nice and hot, just as Josh said, and I yearned to climb in. <i>&quot;No!&quot;</i> 
	I told myself, <i>&quot;first things first,&quot;</i></span></p>
