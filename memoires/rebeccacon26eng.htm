    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After I ate my lunch 
    with Dr. Hamilton, he really did have something he wanted to talk about. He 
    said he wanted me to experience two more uploads to make a total of three. 
    Then he wanted to do an extraction. I was excited for this. Now maybe Carmen 
    could experience something exciting from me! I had all these ideas for good 
    extraction's. Like the time Carrie and I went to New Orleans &quot;to research 
    the old plantations.&quot; At least that was the excuse we told the professors as 
    to why we were going to miss a week and a half of school. Of course we spent 
    two days researching, completely hung over after a week long Mardi Gras 
    celebration! Carrie swears we were flashing everyone for beads, but I don't 
    remember doing it!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Or there was the time 
    Josh and I flew to Florida and pretended we were newlyweds. He got this 
    promotion through his work for newlywed couples. They got to stay for a week 
    in an Alternative Resort in Key West at half price. It was an adult resort 
    called the Atlantic Shores Resort. (Adult meaning that in certain areas 
    clothing was optional! We only walked by those areas getting small glimpses 
    of people and laughing about it later. It was crazy!) The plane tickets were 
    half price as well, and the food was all complimentary! We had so much fun!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As I rambled on, Dr. 
    Hamilton sat and listened. He told me those were all good ideas for 
    extraction's, but what he had in mind was different. He wanted to extract 
    the first time I can remember being afraid of bees. He wanted <i>&quot;...to get 
    the worst over first...&quot;</i>&nbsp; I wasn't too happy about this but I told him I 
    would do it under one condition, that the day after the extraction I wanted 
    the cabin and wild flowers upload. He said that wouldn't be a problem. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I watched him write on 
    a calendar in my file. He wrote on tomorrow's date, &quot;Ocean Walk,&quot; the day 
    after that; &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; next day; &quot;First Exraction-Bee Memory,&quot; then; &quot;Hillside 
    Cabin.&quot; After he was done writing he looked up at me. I turned my head in 
    time that he didn't know I saw what he was writing. I pretended to be 
    reading this framed poster behind the desk in his personal office. I have a 
    feeling someone had it made for him because it read, <i>&quot; The mind is a 
    terrible thing to waste, let Braintec extract it all first.&quot;</i> I smiled to 
    myself and then asked Dr. Hamilton if we were done here. He said yes, but he 
    wanted me to arrive at his office about half hour before my upload tomorrow. 
    There was something he wanted to discuss with me. I asked if he wanted me to 
    stay now, but he said it would be best to talk about it in the morning. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I thanked him for the 
    lunch and left. I was kind of relieved to be out of there. As I was walking 
    to my room I passed Carmen in the hall. She was staring out a window. When I 
    approached her I asked her if everything was okay. I could tell she had been 
    crying. I motioned her back to our room. I told her we could talk alone 
    there. She said to me, <i>&quot;All you ever want to do is talk! You don't know 
    me like you think you do. I don't always tell you everything! Besides, I 
    don't feel like talking right now! So just leave me alone!&quot;</i>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was shocked that she 
    would talk to me like that. I just walked away not sure what to say or do. I 
    wondered if her conversation with Diego had gone sour and she was taking it 
    out on me. Or could she really mad at me for some reason? I decided I wasn't 
    going to let her remarks hurt my feelings. She was obviously stressed and 
    just needed to be alone for a while to clear her mind. I'm sure thing will 
    be back to normal tomorrow.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial"> &nbsp;</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
