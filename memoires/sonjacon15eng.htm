    <span style="font-family: Arial">Back in Tokyo, Paul parked the car in a 
    backstreet. Two bold Japanese (yes, those exist) came out of a house to 
    threw Rosanne and Adrian easily over their shoulders and bring them back in. 
    Paul and I followed them. I waited patiently in a room with rice papered 
    walls, while Paul prepared the M-Stores. A smiling and bowing woman brought 
    me some tea. It took long before Paul returned. <i>“Yes sorry,” </i>he said,
    <i>“but I had to arrange some things for you before you can go to the 
    bloodbank.&quot;</i> He comforted me by explaining extensively how the FBI would 
    deliver the Canadian into the hands of the Japanese intelligence. And 
    Kodjiro, I wondered. According to Paul he wouldn’t be of any danger: he 
    would have plunged himself into deep debts at the jakuza, and the FBI is 
    satisfied when he loose his honour and one finger... </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">We went out for some food, and Paul told me 
    endlessly about his ranch, and how much he missed it. His stories were so 
    colourful and detailed that I started to miss that ranch as well. Now and 
    then he looked at me tenderly. I didn’t know how to respond, and broke the 
    tensions with jokes. But from the inside I was glowing from desire. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The bloodbank was a piece 
    of cake. The Canadian was there, but Kodjiro wasn’t. He took Rosanne and 
    Adrian’s M-Stores a bit amazed but very delighted, and mentioned that I 
    would go far in &quot;the organization&quot;. After which I walked out of the 
    bloodbank, to the car where Paul was waiting for me. While we drove away I 
    saw about 8 or 10 police cars arriving at the entrance with shrieking brakes 
    and dozens of policemen with guns and bulletproof jackets rushed into the 
    building.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Are you going with me to Portland?&quot;</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    Paul asked in the car. I was shocked by his vigour – he wouldn’t let the 
    grass grow under his feet. <i>&quot;To Braintec?&quot;</i> I asked superfluously. Paul 
    had to do some business with dr. Hamilton. Before I was aware I said yes. 
    Paul carefully took my hand and kissed it, after which he gave me this 
    piercing look and said: <i>&quot;I’m glad you do.&quot;</i> We drove to my guesthouse 
    to pick up my suitcase, which was hardly unpacked, and drove to the airport. 
    We had to wait a couple of hours for the next flight. Paul was reading a 
    newspaper, and I laid my head on his shoulder and fell asleep immediately. 
    We didn’t say much during the trip to Portland. There was a relaxed silence 
    and we enjoyed each others company. </span></p>
