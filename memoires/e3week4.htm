    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">It’s raining cats and 
    dogs. One endless flood coming down from heaven as if the dam’s burst. Twigs 
    and leaves being taken along in little streams. The little light that comes 
    through the dark clouds is diffused by the heavy curtains of rain. Besides 
    the clattering of water there is nothing to be heard. No dogs outside, let 
    alone the people to walk them. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    couldn’t stay in any longer. On bear feet I stood out in the pouring rain as 
    if taking a shower: the water was not cold and made my nightgown stick to my 
    body. Around my feet a puddle formed that engulfed my toes. The rainwater 
    blending in with my tears. I wasn’t sad and I haven’t felt any pain for the 
    last few days. Still the tears kept coming. Without making a sound I let 
    everything flow from me as the rain washed me clean. I suppose I stood in 
    the rain like that for at least ten minutes. I wouldn’t have minded to stay 
    out there longer. I felt at one with the elements. I hadn’t felt so calm in 
    a long time. But it wasn’t allowed. It wasn’t normal. Two assistants pulled 
    me back in. They brought me to my room and recommended me to take a warm 
    shower and then hit the sack. I have showered enough but I am tired. Crying 
    has worn me out. </span></p>
