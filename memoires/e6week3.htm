    exceeded all previous experiences. They already told me that from today we’d 
    be going for the ‘real thing’, but I never thought that a re-experience 
    could be so complex. It seemed like some sort of film, so lifelike that I 
    wasn’t viewing it but actually went through it myself. I sat in the chair, 
    and got the thingy’s taped to my head and neck again. The room was darkened 
    and after the relaxation exercises the upload started. I went right in from 
    the word go.</span></p>

    magnificent view over an environment which had to be to the </span>

    Grand Canyon for real but I recognized it from documentaries and pictures.

    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I felt satisfied and had tired legs, 
    as if I’d walked for miles. The atmosphere was reddish and the images 
    forming before my eyes were sharp and clear. There were two other people of 
    whom I knew that they had also been walking. I felt attracted to the woman 
    and admired her. For the man I felt comradeship. A good friend. For just a 
    moment the image of a car came up, I knew it belonged to the friend. I saw 
    some more images of the beautiful environment, that dusty smell came up 
    again and then it was all gone. The light came on immediately, and I wished 
    I could have stayed in the dark a bit longer. Suddenly I knew the names of 
    the two people: <i>“Matthew and Nancy!”</i> I said cheerfully. <i>“I’ve been 
    walking for several hours with them at the Grand Canyon </i></span><i>
