    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I have to 
    pick up my “hard earned” money from Tachikawa. So I have to get the DOSS 
    parts, the software and the hardware across. Maybe I can pick up Rosanne. 
    And my cheque. That seems to be a good idea. While I went to bed again, with 
    my mind full of thoughts I heard the sound of a car outside. I peeped out 
    through the window to the parking lane. It was Adelle. She stepped out of 
    the car and headed for her apartment’s door in a hurry. She was alone. There 
    was no sign of Steward. I jumped out of bed quickly and got dressed. I saw 
    Adelle walking in the corridor to her room and I softly called her name 
    while I was still putting my shirt on. Adelle turned on. I got shocked, how 
    she looked like! Her blouse was torn apart, her hair was messed up and she 
    had a black eye. <i>“Well, that wasn’t an easy night, I can see”</i> I 
    started. </span></p>

        questions about his plans with Braintec’s information and techniques, 
        for his own sake, I started to accuse him of pornographic practises. I

    I asked worriedly. <i>“No, I didn’t, I told him I’d heard from Rosanne.”</i>&nbsp; 
    Said Adelle. <i>“I believe hearing Rosanne’s name drove him over the edge”</i>. 
    Adelle said they were still having dessert. They had been drinking the whole 
    evening hoping Steward would get a lack of discretion. &nbsp;<i>“Well he didn’t 
    get that loose-lipped. The only thing he lost was his control”</i>. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">She said 
    that Steward wanted to leave right away, putting some money on the table and 
    dragged her outside. When they reached the corner of the restaurant he 
    jammed her to the door and tried to let her confess all she knew about him. 
    Adelle didn’t speak and that made him furious. He hit her hard and Adelle 
    tried to run away, but he was holding her too tight. She broke free and tore 
    her blouse. Then she started to run and hailed a cab and drove away. She had 
    been driving for fifteen minutes and was then driven to her car. Then she 
    came here. <i>“Shall we ever see Steward again?”</i> I asked. <i>“I don’t 
    know. He won’t be that smart if he comes to here now.”</i> Said Adelle. <i>
    “I assume he will keep some distance for a while.”</i> I asked Adelle if 
    there was something she wanted or needed. <i>“Yes, I long for a nice shower 
    and sleep afterwards. It is a quarter past three, I am deadly tired and also 
    a bit drunk, and tomorrow I will sleep late and see for then.” “Okay, sleep 
    well and see you tomorrow.” </i>I said and walked back to my room and jumped 
    into bed. Shall Steward report himself sick, or shall he resign? Well, I 
    will notice soon enough.</span><i><span style="font-family:Arial">
