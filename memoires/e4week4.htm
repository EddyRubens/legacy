    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">She got an extensive tour through the 
    complex and afterwards went for lunch with Dr. Hamilton and Dr. Tachikawa. 
    Jessica told the woman wants to have her personal memories recorded. She is 
    willing to pay a lot for it. Now that she’s almost seventy, she is really 
    afraid to lose her memory. I thought she was no more than fifty but a closer 
    look at her hands and neck confirmed it. Those can’t be smoothed out so 
    easily. If besides her memories her youth could be re-implanted as well I’m 
    sure she wouldn’t mind to pay even more. </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I’m curious as to 
    whether she’ll get what she wants. I may not be an expert in judging who is 
    suitable as a subject or not, but this woman strikes me as particularly 
    unfit. Not only is she a walking wreck, she stressed that she hasn’t been 
    feeling very good lately. Maybe she feels the end is near and is only trying 
    to stretch things a little with the help of Braintec. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">If I should ever have 
    as much money as that I will definitely not spend it on something so crazy. 
    I’d spend it on something fresh, one of those tourist trips through space 
    for instance. I think it would be more enjoyable to have new experiences 
    than to obsessively relive old ones. But, who knows, maybe she wants to have 
    her memories recorded for posterity. Grandma’s special photo album. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I dislike women like 
    her, really. Her personality even outdoes the penetrating smell of her 
    perfume. From the moment she set foot in the building she acted as if she 
    owned the place. Hovering through the halls like a queen. What I found just 
    as deranged was the team member’s attitudes. They acted as if she was 
    royalty too. If she would have asked them to paint the place purple they 
    probably would have done it. I understand that the research that’s going on 
    at Braintec is costing a lot, but how far can they go? I hope the team has 
    enough backbone to refuse this woman. The other day I heard Dr. Hamilton 
    moan about there not being much money left and the need for more sponsors. 
    If she is accepted, it might say more about Braintec’s present state than 
    about her. </span></p>
