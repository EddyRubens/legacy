    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    was determined to see Kodjiro before leaving. Jessica told me that he might 
    not get arrested, but still he shouldn’t expect much support from the FBI. 
    He was in way too deep and has been on the wrong side of the deal too many 
    times. She tried to talk me into forgetting about him but without success. 
    Another matter was that the risk of someone seeing me alive was too big. But 
    I definitely wanted to see him one more time and nobody was going to stop 
    me. Anyway, it was another four hours before my flight was due. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I took the metro 
    looking silly because of a dumb hat that Jessica forced me to wear. As I 
    walked from the station to his apartment a melancholic feeling came over me. 
    These streets that had become so familiar to me, I would probably never see 
    them again. I was going to miss the musical noises at the crossing. As I 
    thought about Kodjiro, saying goodbye seemed impossible. How could I ever 
    say farewell to him? The last two streets walking up to the apartment I got 
    a feeling. Something was wrong. I would have to be very careful. Keeping a 
    watchful eye, I walked towards the door as inconspicuously as I could. The 
    porter opened the door for me. <i>“Mrs. Klaveren, it’s not safe here. You 
    better go.”</i> I ignored what he said and hurried upstairs to find an 
    incredible mess there. The entire apartment was turned upside down. Somebody 
    had done their best to ravage the place. Maybe they’d been looking for 
    something. It was virtually impossible to walk on the mats without standing 
    on an object. I was a little scared. What if I would find Kodjiro dead in 
    one of the rooms? Maybe with a knife sticking in his throat! Even the 
    chopsticks in the kitchen and the bath foam in the shower were on the floor. 
    But thankfully, a dead Kodjiro was not to be found. But where could he be?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I decided to wait for 
    Kodjiro. But it seemed wise not to wait in his apartment. The people who had 
    made this mess might come back or I might even be falsely accused by the 
    police. So I waited on the sidewalk beside the porter. He knew I had been up 
    there for only 5 minutes. It would obviously have taken a lot longer to 
    cause the mess that was up there. We didn’t speak. I sat there for about an 
    hour without saying a word. It was strange. But it didn’t bother me. It gave 
    me a chance to put things into perspective. It suddenly seemed very unlikely 
    to me that Kodjiro was going to come back here. Had he already seen the 
    mess? Slowly it dawned on me that things had come to an end here. It was 
    over. Checking in for international flights starts early. And it takes an 
    hour to get there by train, if I can get on one right away. There was no use 
    in waiting anymore. No goodbyes then. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Crestfallen, I walked 
    back to the metro station. It hurt. But there was nothing else to do. I had 
    to catch that flight. For the last time I listened to the irritating 
    Nintendo noises at the crossing. Then I saw it. Braintec images on a plasma 
    screen! It was a news bulletin showing between the commercials, showing 
    footage of the Canadian, handcuffed! Head down into a police van. More 
    people who’d been arrested were shown. Some I knew, some I didn’t. Then the 
    reporter came on, speaking that unintelligible language. I was nailed to the 
    ground. How many of them had been arrested? Kodjiro too? I hadn’t seen him 
    on the screen. But that meant nothing of course. A gentle push in the back 
    brought me back to reality. About fifty people behind me were starting to 
    cross the street. After crossing I stood on the other side, still numb. 
    There was another video screen at the station’s entrance. And opposite of 
    that screen sat… Kodjiro! He looked a mess. He’d obviously been fighting and 
    wasn’t wearing any shoes. He watched the same images I had seen, looking 
    defeated. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">I don’t know how 
    long I stood there watching him like that. I wanted to call out to him, but 
    I couldn’t. Even walking towards him seemed impossible. Something in me 
    snapped, and I could only watch him. The next group of people had crossed 
    the street and came walking into the station. Impassive, I moved along with 
    them. I had a plane to catch.</span>&nbsp;</b></p>
