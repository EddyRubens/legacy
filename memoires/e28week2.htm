    Again Kodjiro was angry at me. Funny though I found it amusing. After a few 
    days of silence and neglecting I rather prefer negative attention than none. 
    And besides, in a fight you can easily say what’s bothering you. As a 
    reaction to my expressions I received a very strange upload.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The fight began with 
    irritation. Kodjiro didn’t like the idea if I went downtown again. When I 
    returned, he was simply furious. Why I was hanging around the 
    Braintec-office all that time. That I have nothing at all to search for in 
    that area. I told him everything that bothered me. Japanese habits, which 
    are hard on me, his silence and my doubts about my stay in his apartment. 
    Everything came out of my mouth so easily. I had kept it for myself already 
    too long. Finally I started crying when all tensions escaped and I ended up 
    into his arms sobbing. Again he was so kind to me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I was relaxing, lying 
    on his bed when he reached for the uploader. Probably it was time for an 
    upload. <i>“These are very special,”</i> Kodjiro said. <i>“They are totally 
    different.”</i> He made me curious. Up till now every upload had been 
    fantastic. Could it be more special? I will find out soon. Kodjiro put the 
    server right above my ear and in no time I was in a totally different world.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    was the best. I was the greatest and the strongest and everybody knew. All 
    women preferred to be with me and men would rather avoid me. Then there was 
    this beautiful one. Her red bottom was shining at me in a tempting way. I 
    ran after her, I fancied her. She turned round towards me for an instant and 
    smiled at me. I acknowledged her tempting behavior by shouting a bit and 
    sent her into the forest. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I was shocked when I 
    discovered I had been a monkey. How come? Testosterones seemed to be still 
    in my body. It felt a bit like adrenaline. I definitely had to do something 
    and jumped out of bed. I fell on the floor with a big sound. What’s going on? 
    My body was out of control. Kodjiro put me back onto the bed and advised me 
    to lie down for a couple of minutes. Until I became a human being again.</span></p>
