	<span style="font-family:Arial">I waited for a short time in the bathroom 
	and decided I would go out to see if Josh had left. I opened the door and 
	called out his name. There was no answer so I quickly went out to the 
	computer. I logged in and saw that I had letters from Megan, Mr. Isakova, 
	and something from the user name Ddavis_cia#102886 I opened Megan's first. 
	It read; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">&quot;Rebecca, This may be 
	my last contact. Tachikawa makes many calls to Japan. He seems paranoid and 
	angry. I am very scared. We are delayed in Athens. Not sure how long. Please 
	inform my father of my current location. Please find me!<br>
	Megan&quot;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Every letter Megan sends is more 
	heart-wrenching. I am very scared for her. I must inform her father that she 
	could possibly be in danger. I opened Mr. Isakova's letter next. It read;
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">&quot;Miss Rebecca Reynolds, 
	I received your email about the transfers Megan will be taking. I have 
	arranged for several of my men to fly out to those locations. I will be 
	going to Japan and wait for the arrival. Is there anything I can do for the 
	help and information you have provided me?<br>
	Mr. Dimitri Isakova&quot;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I felt that this was the only opportunity I 
	was going to get. I wrote Mr. Isakova a letter explaining how Kaleb tried to 
	help Megan. I told him how she mentioned that something bad must have 
	happened to Kaleb because he was left for dead in Nova Scotia. I also told 
	him how I was still worried about Carmen and that I had no idea where she 
	even is now.&nbsp; I shared how I was worried about my own well being and I 
	explained how the Agents found Josh and Diego and act as though they have 
	total control over them as well myself. I let him know that I wanted out and 
	was afraid to go back to the facility without Carmen.&nbsp; I ended the letter to 
	Mr. Isakova asking if there was anything he could do to help me in any of 
	these aspects? I had one more letter to read. The one with the strange user 
	name. I opened the email.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">Rebecca,<br>
	It is Kaleb. I will be sharing this name, that of a fellow CIA agent, 
	located in Maine. You probably are wondering what happened to Megan and I. 
	Tachikawa has taken her against her will. I had to leave Braintec 
	immediately in order to stay on his trail. In Nova Scotia, I was able to 
	free Megan for a short time. We left the airport and headed to the parking 
	lot. There, Tachikawa found us and used a car as a weapon against me.&nbsp; I was 
	lucky enough to survive the collision into the car. I don't remember much 
	after that. I do not know where Megan is now. I am writing to let you know 
	that I am doing all that I can to help your friend. I have not abandoned you 
	and Carmen. If you have any information that could help, please email me at 
	this address. I will be working with Agent David D. Davis. He or myself can 
	be trusted with any information you might have.<br>
	Kaleb Desmond&quot;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">So much was happening and so many people 
	seemed to depend on me. I wrote a quick letter to the address Kaleb left and 
	told him I would only give him information in person. There were too many 
	people I didn't trust and I told him I hoped he would understand. </span>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">When I turned off the 
	computer, I decided that I was going to tell Josh everything I knew. He 
	promised to do everything he could to help, and I trusted he will keep his 
	promise. I went into the bathroom and climbed into shower and tried to 
	relax, even if it was for only a short time.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
