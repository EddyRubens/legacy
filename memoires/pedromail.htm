      people,</font></i></p>
        <p><i><font face="Arial" color="#000000">I will write this in English, 
        so everybody will be able to read it. First of all, I must insist on 
        your discretion, and in no way this letter may fall in the hands of the 
        Braintec employees (you will understand why when you read further). 
        Except for Rosanne, she is my lifeline now and you can trust her. If you 
        want to answer this email, please give it to her and she will sent it to 
        my secret email address.<br>
        You have noticed that I 'vanished' from Braintec for quite a while now. 
        I will explain to you what happened.<br>
        My last day at &quot;Braintec&quot; (at least that's what they call themselves) 
        was when Tachikawa tucked me in with a sleeping pill. When I woke up I 
        found myself on the floor of a dark room, alone, it looked and smelled 
        like a basement. I was still pretty sedated, and kept on falling asleep 
        and waking up again. At one time a woman came in and brought me a 
        blanket and a glass of water.<br>
        Next thing I know I was in a car, gagged and blindfolded, sitting in 
        between two persons, who didn't say a word. I don't know how long we 
        drove, but it seemed like hours. The car stopped (gravel) and when they 
        helped me out, I could smell the iodine scent of seaweed, and mimosa, 
        and I could hear waves pounding on a beach in the distance. Inside, 
        someone pushed me gently into a chair and removed my gag and blindfold. 
        My eyes needed some getting used to the light, and after that I saw that 
        I was in a small country cottage, English style. In front of me in a 
        chair there was an older man, grey haired, handsome, with friendly eyes, 
        observing me quietly while stroking his chin. Behind this man, with one 
        hand on the man's chair, was ... Hugo. And my 'dearest husband' was 
        smiling at me. I was so shocked that the only thing coming from my mouth 
        was &quot;Wha....&quot;<br>
        The older man started to speak to me in English, with a warm 
        French-Canadian accent it seemed, but addressed me (despite having a 
        French surname) as &quot;mrs. Bootoil&quot; He first apoligized repeatedly for my 
        abduction, and that this &quot;wasn't the way they normally operated,&quot; but in 
        my case certainly neccesary, &quot;for security reasons.&quot; Hugo didn't say a 
        word. What his explanation came down to was this. The &quot;Braintec&quot; 
        institute is just a tiny subsidiary of a bigger, global company called 
        MemoCorp, which in its turn is financed by a secret think tank 
        organization called 'Project for a New Global Order' (PNGO). He didn't 
        mention who precisely its members were, but he said &quot;think about the 
        most powerful persons in the United States at the moment.&quot; He spoke 
        about the PNGO lovingly, as if it was his favourite grandchild.<br>
        Last year, the PNGO &quot;bought&quot; a scientific research project of, how 
        surprising, Dr. Tachikawa. On memory implants, as you all are well 
        familiar with. The PNGO assigned MemoCorp to build an implant from Dr. 
        Tachikawa's design, and to find a way to minimise its volume and to 
        mass-produce them. But that was not the whole story. The Defense 
        administration in the Pentagon, as well as the CIA (both highly 
        represented in the PNGO) wanted to develope a &quot;devise to insert the 
        implants from a range of 200 meters or more.&quot; Surely, he was talking 
        about some sort of gun, a weapon to be used in warfare. And Hugo, who 
        still didn't say a word, already worked for the PNGO for over 10 years - 
        his practise in the hospital was just a cover-up.<br>
        I know, all of this is hard to believe, and if I wasn't abducted, I 
        wouldn't believe me either. But now you know what's really going on, and 
        what you are a test rabbit for... Please, everybody, get out of there as 
        soon as possible, these people aren't joking.</font></i></p>
        <p><i><font face="Arial" color="#000000">After the explanation of the 
        older man, Hugo brought me upstairs to a bedroom, gave me a sleeping 
        pill and told me to rest a while. &quot;For what?&quot; I asked. &quot;Don't worry dear, 
        everything's gonna be just fine,&quot; he answered me in a reassuring voice. 
        Meanwhile I felt as if I was playing a part in a mediocre cold war movie. 
        I took the pill, pulled up the covers, and when Hugo left, I thought 
        things over. Why did they tell me all this? Weren't they afraid I was 
        going to tell someone? Then I really got scared. No, of course they 
        aren't afraid ... because they are going to kill me! I jumped out of 
        bed. Although the pill already started working, my head was clear. I had 
        to get out of there, fast. I looked out of the window, it was already 
        dark, and I saw that it was ever so easy to climb out and jump in the 
        garden. Even the window wasn't locked, which strengthened my idea that 
        their plan was to silence me forever. &quot;Pushin' up the daisies,&quot; my 
        grandmother used to say. I thought of her, a tough and courageous old 
        lady, when I jumped on the grass. I bruised my knee, but nothing was 
        broken - I tried to ignore the pain while I ran (unnoticed!) towards the 
        shelter of some pine trees ajacent to the lawn. Still running, in the 
        corner of my eye I saw that a bright light went on, illuminating the 
        garden, but I kept on running. I figured it would be best not to run in 
        a straight line, but zig-zag towards the beach, the least likely place 
        to find shelter. I ran trough a vast area of sand dunes with thorny 
        bushes, shredding my stockings to pieces but I didn't care because I 
        wasn't being Miss World right now. After about half an hour I was 
        exhausted and rested for a while. In the distance I could see flash 
        lights, and hear people calling my name. I was so tired, that I wasn't 
        even scared anymore. I fell asleep.<br>
        I woke up the next morning, on the same spot, and the world was bright 
        and sunny, as if nothing had happened and it was all just a bad dream. 
        But I wasn't planning to doubt myself again - ever. After an hour's 
        walk, I arrived at a road, and later a gas station - with a bus stop. I 
        refreshed myself and succeeded to get some cash from my credit card (don't 
        leave home without it) from the friendly manager.</font></i></p>
        <p><i><font face="Arial" color="#000000">I am sending you this letter 
        from Tokyo. I don't have time now to explain what I'm doing here, so

        you can, leave Braintec, it's a dangerous place!</font></i></p>
