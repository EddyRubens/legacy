    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">A little over 
    an hour had passed when I called the phone number again. I was eager to tell 
    Agent Andrews all the information that Carmen had found out. When I dialed 
    the phone number, I got the busy signal. Obviously this phone thing wasn't 
    going to work. (I have to be honest, the fact that the CIA couldn't get a 
    simple phone to work had me a little on edge. These were the men I was 
    putting my trust in, the men who were going to get us out of this huge mess 
    and capture Dr. Tachikawa?) I pulled out my laptop and once again emailed 
    the CIA address that I had used before. I was automatically connected with 
    Agent Andrews. Since the phone was </span><span style="font-family: Arial">
    not working he must have been waiting online to speak with me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">
    Miss Reynolds, <br>
    Is there a place you know of where we can meet?&nbsp; I can arrange one if you'd 
    like. Would you feel comfortable letting me choose a location this time? <br>
    Agent D.A. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I responded back; <br>
    <i>Agent Andrews, I would feel safe at any location you choose as long as 
    Josh, Diego and Carmen are there as well. Please notify me as to where and 
    when you would like to meet. Just to make things clear, Carmen and I will 
    not enter any location until Josh and Diego are present. I am sorry if this 
    may be any sort of an insult to you. We have been through too much and have 
    a hard time trusting people. I hope you will understand.<br>
    Rebecca</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I waited for a minute, 
    telling Carmen what I had told Agent Andrews. She agreed that it was a good 
    idea to have our guys there. A response came from Agent Andrews;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">Miss Reynolds,
    <br>
    Agent Jacobs and myself take no offense to your request. We are pleased to 
    know you are taking all precautions you feel necessary. We have set up a 
    meeting location. It is a hotel called Staybridge Suites. It is not far from 
    where you are located now. It is precisely 8 miles from the Japanese Gardens. 
    Mr. Conners (Josh) and Mr. Montero (Diego) will meet you and Miss Castillo (Carmen) 
    in the front lobby. From there they will bring you to our suite, where we 
    will discuss further plans. I have sent you a map. Please meet us tonight at 
    7:30pm. If this time is not available to you, please send a response as to 
    when a better time might be. <br>
    Agent D.A.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I sent one 
    more letter.<br>
    <i>Agent Andrews,<br>
    Even though Dr. Tachikawa is gone, the rules are the same around here. They 
    usually don't like us to be out too late in the evenings. Would 6:30pm be 
    okay with you?<br>
    Rebecca</i></span></p>
