    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I like this Sonja and 
    i like Adrian as well and actually the rest also. Even Adelle. But sometimes 
    I’m a bit scared for Rosanne. She can behave so odd. I was only taking my 
    time around the lavatories. After washing my hands I wanted to do my eyes 
    and use some body lotion, then she almost exploded. She was talking about 
    aesthetic perfection and the balance of power. While I did nothing wrong. 
    Almost scary. She wanted to know if I had my breast done like all the other 
    American girls. I couldn’t get a word out of my mouth when it happened, it 
    was too hard to tell. The good response comes always afterwards. When I told 
    her later, she could not remember the incident and she was kind to me as if 
    nothing happened. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It’s a pity that 
    Jessica left. I would certainly talk this through with her but not with 
    Sheila. That Sheila is not so kind. A bit sternly. I don’t know if Jessica 
    is on a holiday or that she’s gone for ever. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">And I feel sorry for 
    Sonja. She has so much to deal with.</span></p>
