    <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: 700">Day X</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I really 
    don’t know what day it is. Actually the first time I had surgery since ages 
    and I’m not really awakening. I also have the feeling that someone is 
    looking inside my diary reading it. That gives me a bit of a scary feeling, 
    as if my privacy is violated. And who is it? Well I decide to continue 
    writing anyway about what I feel and think. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
    implant was successful, oh yeh, they gave me the biggest one of course, or 
    at least it feels that way. I am curious what things they will record. I 
    know about some very ‘hot’ memories in my mind. And it will certainly tell a 
    lot about the choice between gentleman/lady. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Who 
    decides anyway what will be recorded? I’m also looking forward to receive 
    memories from others. I have already prepared some tests to detour the 
    unconsciousness. It feels like an enforcement of the normal working between 
    consciousness and unconsciousness. and were it will end, in the 
    consciousness part or in the unconsciousness. It would be a great step when 
    it becomes possible to load information directly into the unconsciousness, 
    but will this knowledge stay intact or, as the implants, be rejected after a 
    while by the body. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">And so 
    there was the definite question Adrian to give my personal opinion. Well 
    what shall I say about that. I think he sees what he wants to see, and that 
    is his right... but I find it a pity to loose objectivity by personal 
    pleasure. Or I’m speaking too easily now and the same will happen to me.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Rosanne 
    is a very nice, but often absent person. Talks too much and often skips from 
    one subject to another... </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Sonja on 
    the other hand is very sweet and hard as a rock at the same time, while she 
    doesn’t realize that. Her bloke thinks he can be cheeky to her under the 
    veil of his weakness. Not that I want to give her advise, who am I to 
    interfere in someone else’s relationship. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I decide 
    to get more in contact with the other test subjects from now on and to get 
    to know the environments as well. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">No more 
    messages from Nursie.... very unusual for her, well she doesn’t have to 
    worry, only a little spot of my hair is cut...</span></p>
