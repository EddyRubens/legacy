    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">After breakfast we disguise 
    ourselves as proper business partners and order a huge taxi. We handle 
    business with Mitsuki. We bought some art from Yukio as well. We only carry 
    our new bought suitcases with hand luggage in it. The rest must be on see by 
    now. After a long drive through the city, industrial areas and some rice 
    fields we arrive at the airport. The driver knows where to find the entrance 
    for rich people. Heather and I are unnoticeable between the business people. 
    Fortunately it all goes smooth at checking inn. Mitsuki arranged it 
    perfectly. Now directly towards the lounge for business class. Through the 
    window we overview the hall for ordinary people. We probably see some 
    Brainteccers. But we are not sure. We settle down in the fluffy furniture 
    and overlook the environment.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">It is a melting pot of Japanese, 
    white people and Arabians. Most of them are properly dressed like we are but 
    there is a terribly dress American couple as well and someone to whom all 
    colors mismatch. It’s even a Dutch guy. I ignore him. A couple of children 
    throws the respectability overboard and jumps at the elegant benches. Nobody 
    stops them. Heather started a conversation with the parents. They are 
    American and lived in Japan for two years. Now they fly back to the States. 
    They have to arrange some things in the nick of time. Heather offers them to 
    take the children to the plane. This way she’s also disguised as a parent. 
    Her plane leaves two hours before mine. With two jumping kids at her side we 
    say goodbye. It isn’t easy. We had such a nice time together. All those 
    troubles couldn’t disturb that. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">With a toddler at each side Heather 
    walks to the gate in her suit. I feel lonely immediately and take my laptop 
    out of the suitcase. This is the end of my diary. Within a few moments I 
    will start a conversation with an economical topic with a business man. Then 
    we can walk without being noticed towards the plane. When I’m back home I’ll 
    have something else on my mind than a diary. Then I’ll write to Heather.&nbsp;
