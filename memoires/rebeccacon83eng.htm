	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I left my room, I decided to head to 
	the Communion-Room, since that is where a lot of the test subject hang out 
	when they are not scheduled for an upload. When I walked in, I saw a face 
	that was strangely familiar but hard to place. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I went in and sat on one of the chairs 
	across the way, but still facing her. I picked up a three month old issue of 
	'People Magazine' and flipped through it. I was paying more attention to her 
	and the slightly older gentleman she was sitting with that the magazine I 
	was holding. Luckily, they seemed too involved with each other to notice my 
	stares. It wasn't until Hans said her name that I realized who she was. 
	(Hans was the name she called him while showcasing a nonstop smile and 
	twirling her platinum blonde hair in her fingers.) <i>&quot;You know Heather...&quot;</i> 
	He said. <i>&quot;I am so glad we met.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Heather! Oh my God! She was the lady at the 
	front desk of The Staybridge Suites.&nbsp; Was she undercover with Dr. 
	Tachikawa's crew? Was she working with Agent Andrews and Agent Jacobs? What 
	was she doing here, and what was she doing with this poor older fool who 
	obviously was falling for her? I decided to leave the Communion-Room before 
	she noticed me.&nbsp;My mind was like a box of puzzle pieces. I had so much to 
	figure out.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I exited the Communion-Room, I 
	unfortunately ran directly into Sheila. I even knocked some files out of her 
	hands. <i>&quot;Shit!&quot;</i> was the fist thing that came to mind. Sheila was one 
	of the people I least wanted and expected to run into. <i>&quot;Oh Sheila,&quot;</i> I 
	said. <i>&quot;I am so sorry about the mixed up papers but I really need to go.&quot;</i> 
	Sheila replied, <i>&quot;Rebecca, we really need to talk soon. You're supposed to 
	come to counseling at least twice a week and you've been putting it off for 
	a while now. Is there something going on that I should know about? You seem 
	to have been a bit frazzled lately.&quot; </i>I stared at her for a moment and 
	then said, <i>&quot;Sheila, I think I ate something that didn't agree with my 
	stomach. I really need to go. I will try to set up a time to talk with you 
	sometime this week.&quot;</i> I was hoping the whole upset stomach story would 
	embarrass her enough to make her leave me alone. <i>&quot;Just remember, 
	Rebecca,&quot; </i>she said. <i>&quot;Anytime you feel the need to talk I'll be here. 
	Just like Dr. Hamilton says, your still priority.&quot; </i>That remark scared me 
	a little as I walked away. Priority? Why was I still a priority now that Dr. 
	Tachikawa had left? I thought Dr. Tachikawa was the one with all the 
	menacing plans, not Dr. Hamilton! </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">The next place I headed was to talk to 
	Carmen's friend Jerry. She told me once that he had a crush on her. I think 
	if I told him she was in trouble he would be willing to help.</span></p>
