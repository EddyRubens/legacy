    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Today I am recovering from surgery.&nbsp; 
    They implanted a device which I am sure you have seen if you have cruised 
    around the web site, and I have to say, the feeling I am having is not one 
    that I expected.&nbsp; <span lang="NL">I was expecting to feel pain, but the odd 
    thing is that I have lost my habits of sensation.&nbsp; I don't feel from within 
    my body, I feel from a witnesses viewpoint.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span lang="NL">Let me try to 
    explain.&nbsp; The flickerings of other memories are already starting, and they 
    are happpening when the psychotropic pain killers are just wearing off, and 
    I am rising out of a short, restive nap.&nbsp; What happens is, I begin to see 
    another world.&nbsp; Not my world, but a world in which I am familiar.&nbsp; I don't 
    exactly feel like a stranger, but I do feel like I am seeing things that 
    I've never seen anything before at all.&nbsp; Yet, it still is familiar.&nbsp; It's 
    like deja vu, but upside down, if that makes sense. </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span lang="NL">I blink, and they 
    are gone, the images.&nbsp; Here are a list of the images I've seen. </span>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span lang="NL">A woman in a green 
    bikini, bending down to adjust the straps on a baby seat in a bike.&nbsp; She is 
    smiling.&nbsp; No sound.&nbsp; She has strawberry blond hair and is wearing a yellow 
    and pink polka dot scarve or head wrap around her hair.&nbsp; She smiles and then 
    laughs and the makes a google face, and then.&nbsp; Gone. </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span lang="NL">A man is eating a 
    potatoe and his moustache is bouncing around.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">A woman, black.&nbsp; She is peeling a 
    sticker off the window of a house damaged by fire.&nbsp; It is an orange and 
    yellow sticker and it doesn not come off without a razor's help.&nbsp;
    <span lang="NL">It flakes off and then leaves white flashes of paper.&nbsp;
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">That's it.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I am seeing the memories from 
    different periods, and from the perspectives of different people, and it is 
    coming together, hardly, barely, as if beads was being slid on to an 
    invisible thread of wire, one bead at a time.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I say this, because it helps explain 
    the lack of pain, though, by all suggestion, there should be pain, as there 
    was the prescription for pain killers.&nbsp; Maybe they aren't painkillers.&nbsp; Well, 
    I won't be paranoid about it.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Well, what I'm saying is that the 
    pain is gone, but in place of pain, I think, is the fading in and out of 
    images.&nbsp; It's as if the pain I felt on earth before dissipates in the form 
    of graphic presentation.&nbsp; <span lang="NL">The drugs are making me weird.&nbsp;
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span lang="NL">Like I said, it's as 
    if I still have my body, but the presentation of images makes me think that 
    I have disappeared, as if I&quot;m in a tube of hallucinations.&nbsp; It's the drugs.&nbsp;
    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span lang="NL">I would still like 
    to have all the bodily privilages I had before my mind implant.&nbsp; What will 
    happen?&nbsp; </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span lang="NL">Tomorrow I will go 
    for a walk if I am healthy and not wobbly.&nbsp; I am feeling a little wobbly, 
    and even my oatmeal makes me queasy.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span lang="NL">Someone left me 
    flowers.&nbsp; I have included a picture of one of them.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
