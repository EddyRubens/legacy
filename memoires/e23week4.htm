    Lucas thought it a great idea to hypnotize me. He overheard the gossips 
    about my misbehavior concerning the small spoons in the coffee-room. He 
    suggested recalling memories of my youth. ‘Coss Dr. Hamilton had this 
    feeling something else was going on. He talked about a child-trauma which 
    could be the cause of the schizoid psychosis. That could explain my 
    delusions. When I told him that I never had bad experiences during my 
    childhood, Dr. Hamilton doubted my words. It was obvious to him that most 
    likely I had hidden away some unpleasant times.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Lucas was hoping to 
    get things clear through hypnosis. It was alright for me. Now that I won’t 
    get any uploads, I have nothing to do. He suggested doing this in my room. 
    Nobody would disturb us there and there’s no place where I feel more 
    comfortable. To calm down completely he switched off the main light, so we 
    only saw the lamp on my desk. Relaxation was no problem at all. In no-time I 
    sunk down into a relaxing fantasy, playing at the lake on a sunny afternoon. 
    Together we went down the long stairs and at every step I went further back 
    in time. Soon we entered the museum of my memories. Piles of boxes and 
    drawers, filled with small and bigger things of my childhood. Heaped up 
    against the walls. All information mixed through each other. A cacophony of 
    voices. A collection like a kaleidoscope of visions, feelings and sounds. I 
    wonder if Lucas understood the whole thing. Unbelievable for me. If my 
    unconscious looks like that, I can imagine I would rather prefer to get rid 
    of that. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Despite the chaos 
    Lucas managed to guide me to the girl of six years old. Nothing was wrong 
    with her. The anxiety for desertion and the traumas Dr. Hamilton was 
    mentioning just a moment before, were not there at all. A happy girl fond of 
    fantasies. So, nothing special. We also met my imaginary friends. I talked 
    about my cuddly toys, my friend from Morocco I was going to marry one day 
    and about my dog Bas. Bas always joined me on a holiday. During the trip I 
    imagined that I was a dog myself and I was married to Bas. Together we would 
    raise five puppies. They were born on the camping site. Instead of playing 
    with other children, I was busy picking and collecting blades of grass while 
    imagining living a dog’s life. I never walked with Bas so often as I did 
    during that particular holiday.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Lucas was satisfied. Nothing wrong with this six-years-old girl. No alarming 
    child-traumas threatening my health. Happy for that. Good to know that no 
    unpleasant memories would show up which I cannot remember at all. Half an 
    hour later I was scared to death. We never had a dog and I have never ever 
    been to France with my parents! And definitely not on a camping site!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Quickly I searched for 
    Lucas. He told me about synthetic memories. How those are often used to 
    replace the real facts. Sometimes to fulfill desires and sometimes to 
    explain things when the truth is too hard to understand. We decided to do 
    another session tomorrow. More a free session this time. Just to walk around 
    in my childhood, as he called it.</span></p>
