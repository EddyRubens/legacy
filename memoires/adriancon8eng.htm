    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It has been a big mess 
    here in Portland. Adelle is great. She is always present. You can hear her 
    affected but somehow contagious laugh resounding throughout the corridors 
    quite often. I can have a laugh with her. She sometimes visits me in my 
    office where I’m working on the dream translator and then asks me several 
    questions about it. She immediately starts to fiddle and screw on everything 
    and I only seem to encourage her when I tell her that the whole thing can 
    possibly explode. I usually suggest to have a break and go for a lunch or 
    sometimes to drink when I have enough of her questions and fiddles. </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Mostly we go for a 
    drink. In the pub she suddenly becomes very good company. Last time she told 
    me about her escape from California, where she lived at the same spot over 
    ten years while nothing happened. Her wealthy life had to be more cheerful. 
    She still hasn’t got the operation and she wonders if she’s going to have an 
    M.S.I. of an M.E.S.I. implant. If I could have a good word about her getting 
    an M.E.S.I. implant. I honestly would love that, because I am deadly curious 
    about her memories. If I could get one of her memories downloaded, I could 
    get a view on her life. That seems to be a nice experience. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She told me that she 
    acquired her money by inheritance and that she had an average income before 
    that. She had worked almost everywhere. From the supermarket till the field 
    of welfare. After she was left an inheritance she met a rich man, with whom 
    she lives together for more than seven years yet. She met Hamilton through 
    that man and that’s how she found a way to escape from her jogtrot life.

    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">She is always in for 
    something funny and when we crossed a flower stall on our way back to the 
    research center she suggested to take some flowers to cheer things up a bit. 
    “Good point” I said. But she has no sense of moderation. We bought over 
    thirty bunches of flowers in all kinds of colors. There were hardly vases at 
    all in the center so now these flowers stand in bottles, pots and buckets on 
    almost every table and in almost every corner of the building. It is a jolly 
    mess. I think Kathy would like this as well, because she found it all so 
    clean.</span></p>
