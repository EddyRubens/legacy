    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">My lovely old sweater 
    was over the top! I entered the laboratory with the sweater in my arms. I 
    was almost seated in the special chair when Dr. Hamilton asked me what I 
    brought with me. <i>“My sweater, “</i> I explained. <i>“This is my favorite 
    sweater, wasn’t I supposed to take it with me?”</i> Dr. Tachikawa confirmed 
    his request but he didn’t look as friendly as he used to do. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial"><i>“Show it to me,”</i> he 
    demanded. I held the sweater uncertainty. Wasn’t it good enough?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial"><i>&nbsp;“What 
    an old junk!” </i>Dr. Hamilton shouted. <i>“From where did you get that? 
    From a hobo?” </i></span><span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Tachikawa and 
    Dr. Steward came closer to take a better look. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial"><i>“And it stinks!”</i> </span>
    </b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Indeed, a vagabond fits 
    it perfectly. The brownish greys with dark smudges give a poorly effect. The 
    few holes I had repaired so carefully did also. I looked dismayed at my 
    sweater and felt a bit ashamed. If you aren’t attached to this sweater as 
    much as I am, it might shock indeed. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">But it is still my favorite 
    sweater! </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Then it almost seemed as if 
    Dr. Hamilton would loose his self-control. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial"><i>“That is totally unexepted!”</i> 
    he shouted. </span><span style="font-family:Arial"><i>“What the hell were 
    you thinking?”</i>&nbsp; What was wrong with him; to shout at me like that! 
    Dr. Tachikawa understood that I had no wrong intentions. He carefully 
    explained how my special sweater could be horrible for others. For this 
    extraction session it was meant to transfer the colors and structure of a 
    cloth, eventually supplemented with a small sense of convenience. Test 
    subjects which would have my memories of this sweater implanted, would 
    probably get very confused if this tatter feels good to them. For an 
    extraction session, my sweater is totally unfit. That I already understood.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">But what 
    now?</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> Jessica interfered carefully. <i>
    “Do you remember the sweater that you bought on Roosevelt Avenue lately?”</i> 
    she almost whispered. </span><i><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">
    “I mean the pink one. </span></i><span style="font-family:Arial"><i>Wouldn’t 
    that be perfect?”</i> I remembered this sweater very well. Almost two weeks 
    ago I suddenly had the impulse that I needed some new clothes and this pink 
    sweater was a real bargain. It was very smooth and it fitted perfectly. 
    Though I feel sorry for this acquisition. It just isn’t the right cloth for 
    me. With all the patterns and that bright pink I look like someone else. I 
    went to my room to get this alternative sweater. The team members were very 
    pleased with it; this sweater really fitted them. They gave me the same 
    explanation about the procedure as yesterday and they underlined that I 
    should not have too much associations. I shouldn’t think about the 
    acquisition and especially not about my favorite sweater. I only had to 
    concentrate on the colors, the viscosity and how the wool touches my skin. I 
    think I managed to do just that. This session went quite smooth, although we 
    had an awkward start. My memory of the pink sweater shall be uploaded 
    tomorrow, ‘coss Dr. Hamilton had another appointment this afternoon. I have 
    no headache this time, but I still feel a bit irritated by the rejection of 
    my favorite sweater. I had to eat some nasty sushi as well, hadn’t I? </span>
