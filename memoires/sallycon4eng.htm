    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I think i know how the 
    images of topples women got through the memory of Mark Steward. I am not 
    gonna tell from whom i know it, it might bring that person in big trouble. 
    But i know for sure that he tells the truth.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It is that japanese 
    man that has some unidentified projects beside it. He records other memories 
    as well, without the knowledge of others. Only for the fun of it. He thinks 
    he will earn more money in the entertainment industry than from medical 
    research. The moaning of Hamilton about money problems and the rules of 
    braintec he must listen to.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I don’t know so well 
    what to think about it. I am curious. What kind of memories are they? 
    Definitely not so innocent as the ones i know so far. Adrian told me that 
    Mark Stewards memory is with sex. I am a bit anxious, wanna try it. is saver 
    than the real thing. With aids and so. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It is rather clear to 
    me now i know. But whose original memory was it, with the pin up thing? I 
    got more questions for every answer i got. The clearer it is, the more 
    questions I have to ask. But i’m not meant to know too much. This is all i’ve 
    got. 1 slip of the tongue was actually one too many. </span></p>
