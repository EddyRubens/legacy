    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I arrived at 
    Kaleb's door, it was already open. I looked inside to see if he was there. 
    It was empty. Completely empty. All of his belonging were gone. I started to 
    feel nauseous. Where was Kaleb? Where has he gone? Why did he leave us here 
    when we needed him the most? Again, there were so many questions. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I figured that I was the only one 
    who could help Megan now. Since the Left Wing and Right Wing were both split 
    into so many sections, I thought I might be able to go through another 
    sector to reach Megan. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">On the way, I 
    had to stop and hide behind a pillar. I noticed Rosanne pacing in the hall 
    in front of one of the meeting room doors. She had her head against the door 
    trying to listen in. Then, every time someone walked by, she would bend down 
    and tie her shoe. After a few minutes, the door flew open. Dr. Tachikawa 
    stormed out. He look more angry and intimidating than I had ever seen him. 
    When Rosanne saw him she quickly turned into the opposite direction. I guess
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial">she wanted him to think she had just 
    walked by. Once Dr. Tachikawa was out of </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">sight she went back to the door 
    and looked in. I figured this was going to be the only chance I had to get 
    into the employee area without being questioned. I put my head down and 
    quickly walked by. I glanced up as I passed the door and saw Dr. Hamilton 
    looking out of the window. Rosanne seemed to be in a world of her own as she 
    stared at him. </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Once I got 
    past her, I walked past a Security Nurse. He stopped me and ask why I was 
    here. I had to do some quick thinking. The only thing I could come up with 
    was, that Sheila sent me down to this area to retrieve a sweater from her 
    room. He stared at me for a minute and then asked why she sent me instead of 
    coming herself. I told him that Sheila had a line up of uploads and meetings 
    scheduled and had no time to run back to her room. I got the impression he 
    was buying my story.&nbsp; <i>&quot;Well, just hurry,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;If anyone else 
    stops you, they'll most likely kick you out of this area.&quot; </i>I hurried 
    down the hall and noticed a sign that said 'Containment Area.' There was an 
    arrow pointing to the right. As I turned, I noticed the Security Nurse's 
    front desk. Shrimp was the only one sitting there. He was munching on a 
    slice of pizza, with the open box next to him. I had no idea how I was going 
    to get passed him. It was 5:00 and I had to get going soon. I held my breath 
    and pulled the same trick as I did with Rosanne. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I put my head 
    down and stared to walk by. I stayed as close as I could to the wall and I 
    was walking on my tip toes, but I didn't get all the way past him. <i>&quot;Hey 
    where do you think you are going?&quot;</i> He yelled out to me. I picked up my 
    pace and rambled on about getting Sheila sweater. <i>&quot;Hey, not that way, you 
    can't go that way!&quot; </i>he said. I just kept walking. I managed to reach the 
    room that Megan said she was in. I had just enough time to glance in to see 
    another empty room. Then, Shrimp grabbed me by my arm and said, <i>&quot;What do 
    you think your doing here?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I was looking for Sheila room. She wants 
    her sweater.&quot;</i> I stuttered. <i>&quot;Your in the wrong area missy, Now get out 
    of here.&quot;</i>&nbsp; He demanded. I turned around and hurried back. Kaleb was gone, 
    now Megan. I was worried </span><span style="font-family: Arial">that I 
    would return to our room and find Carmen gone. </span>
