    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Well, I just returned 
    from the tour. Quite amazing. I admit, now that I have seen the facility, 
    samples of the MSI and MESI implants, how clean everything is, and how nice 
    the staff are, I hope I do get chosen for an implant. I of course am hoping 
    for the MESI. They were using percentages of how many can get which 
    particular implant. I think that they said 80% can get the MESI. It would be 
    so exciting to experience my own memories as well as someone else's! I met a 
    few of the people who have the implants. Their names escape my mind right 
    now but they were all very helpful and were eager to share their experiences.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was however a bit 
    irritated when Rosanne made us all wait in the hall while she stared at a 
    bouquet of flowers that was sent to her. She was talking to some woman with 
    whom she was giggling and reading a card with. We waited out in the hall for 
    a good 10 minutes. I know receiving flowers is exciting but it seemed a bit 
    unprofessional to have us all standing around in the hallway. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton was nice. 
    He seemed to have a lot on his mind so he didn't chat for too long. He 
    welcomed us all and excused himself to a meeting. I suppose being the 
    director of such a facility is very time consuming. Not much time is left 
    for small conversations.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As we went along the 
    tour I met Sheila. She is the psychologist. She seems very level headed. I 
    over heard a few people talking about her. They said she was a bit 
    unfriendly and hard to talk to. She seemed nice enough to me. I mean, I 
    wouldn't go out of my way to start a conversation with her, but I wouldn't 
    not talk to her if I needed answers. I wonder what this Jessica person they 
    were talking about was like.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Everyone else seemed 
    nice, but I am not to sure about Mark Steward. I know I shouldn't pass 
    judgment about someone I don't know, but this guy seemed creepy. He was 
    staring at me and this other girl on the tour (I think her name was Megan) 
    as though he could see right through our clothes. I wondered what kind of 
    memories he has. I bet there are no cute puppy dogs and ice cream cones in</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">
