    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It took me until 3:15 
    to find Carmen in the Japanese Gardens. She was sitting behind a large and 
    beautifully shaped Bonsai Tree. She was afraid to sit where anyone might see 
    her. We sat there and she shared everything that was happening. I will 
    explain.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Apparently when 
    Carmen joined Braintec she was pregnant. She didn't tell Diego because she 
    knew he would never let her do this while she was pregnant. Carmen also was 
    not sure she wanted to keep it. When she arrived, she assured the company 
    she was going to have the procedure. They talked her out of it with a bribe 
    of money. They persuaded her to let them not only put an implant in Carmen, 
    but in the unborn baby as well. I guess Dr. Tachikawa made a special MESI 
    implant small enough to fit in the head of an unborn baby. Only Millimeters 
    in size. This was a plan he came up with so that people could experience 
    memories in the womb. That is why she was in recovery so long. They all just 
    lied to me because this is a Top Secret project. She is five months 
    pregnant, but you can hardly even tell. She has been wearing larger clothes 
    to hide her stomach. The doctors said that since the baby's internal organs 
    and nervous system are fully developed they want to start to do extraction's. 
    They warned her that they have never done this before and they can't 
    guarantee that the baby will survive through an extraction. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen said she has 
    come to realize that her baby's life is more important than any sum of money. 
    She wants to have the implants removed from herself and the baby but was 
    threatened when she spoke to Dr. Tachikawa about it. She asked me what she 
    should do. She can't tell Diego. She can't trust Dr. Tachikawa, and 
    apparently Dr. Hamilton knows about it and has done nothing. She has put her 
    faith in me. I am so scared and confused. I can only imagine what </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">she must be feeling.</span></p>
