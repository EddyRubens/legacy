    fell asleep after I ate. Yesterday was extremely exhausting! Carmen is still 
    asleep. Good thing, because now I feel like I need to keep a close look out 
    for her. I figure, if I am always around, Dr. Tachikawa and Dr. Hamilton 
    won't be able to manipulate her. I have to think of something soon. Even 
    though I was nervous to open the email from the CIA, it figured that it 
    might just be nothing. </span></p>

    It is to our understanding that you, as well as others, are involved in an 
    organization which involves memory recall. This is an experiment that a 
    former scientist and colleague of the CIA was involved with. When terminated 
    for specific reasons, he took with him some of the highly sensitive 
    equipment used in this procedure and many of the M-stores. (These were the 
    extracted and stored memories of CIA 'Test Subjects.') We are still 
    uncertain if any of the Doctors or Scientists in your facility are the 
    specific person who stole these materials from the CIA. We have only written 
    to few 'members' belonging to Braintec . We do not want anyone to be 
    suspicious. If he was to flee again, our many months of surveillance will 
    have gone to waste. We only wish to apprehend this criminal and return the 
    equipment and any, if not all of the 'Test Subjects' to a safe and highly 
    monitored facility. We are writing to you to ask for your help. Please 
    respond.<br>
    Agent David M. Andrews&quot;</span></p>
