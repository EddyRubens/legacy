    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">When I 
    was rethinking about the whole thing at night in my room I suddenly realized 
    that we might perhaps – without wanting it – be part of a 
    multi-million-dollar industry. Or were we on the wrong site? No, definitely 
    not, but it all seemed very alluring. So close at the fire of the big money. 
    I had to consider this. At the other hand, those uploads were not to be 
    sneezed at. Could I ever live without those beautiful memories? Adelle is 
    also operated and I would love to get to know her better. I must visit her 
    tomorrow. To see how she’s doing with that thing inside her head. </span>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I 
    couldn’t find sleep this night. I have woken up at least ten times. What is 
    this al about? Do I still wish to stay here? At four o’clock I got out of 
    bed and went to the kitchen. See what’s inside the fridge. I am always in 
    the mood for a sandwich with tunic salad. When I steered aimlessly I 
    realized that I am here in Portland for two and a halve month already. And I 
    still hadn’t seen a glimpse of the environment yet. It was time for a trip. 
    A tour and a hike through the nature would be a good thing to do. Being away 
    form this pandemonium, you could easily name it so. I decided to rent a car 
    next weekend and drive to the Crater Lake National Park. I have heard about 
    it and it must be magnificent. And especially very quiet. That is what I 
    need right now. I will leave at Friday afternoon. I had some sleep after 
    this comforting thought. I woke up early, in spite of the bad night’s sleep. 
    I am on the list for an upload this afternoon. I desire one. No idea what is 
    waiting for me, but it is certainly something nice. With this thought I got 
    up and took my time taking a shower. I decide to have a restful morning and 
    at half past one I walked slowly to the wing where I’m getting my upload.
