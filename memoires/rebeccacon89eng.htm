	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I reached Thomas' room, I heard some 
	music through the door. I got a quick flash back of Kaleb and when we first 
	met. I knocked hard on the door, letting experience be my guide. After a 
	moment, the music volume was lowered and Thomas opened the door. It looked 
	as though he had just gotten out of the shower. He was wearing jeans with no 
	shirt. His cologne set me in a trance. It smelled so wonderful and a bit 
	erotic. He smiled at me and invited me in. His room was suprisingly clean.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial"><i>&quot;I just got out of the shower.&quot;</i> He 
	said. <i>&quot;Oh, sorry!&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;I didn't mean to interrupt you. I can 
	come back later.&quot; &quot;You're not interrupting,&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;I'm done with 
	the shower. Just felt like taking one when I got back from this really 
	strange upload. But what's up, girl? You finally realize you wanted real 
	man?&quot; &quot;Why Thomas...&quot;</i> I said acting like a Southern Belle. <i>&quot;Surly 
	your not coming on to little old me!&quot;</i> He shook his head and smiled at 
	me. I think, he thought, I was flirting with him. He leaned over and kissed 
	me. I liked it and didn't stop him. It wasn't until I realized that I was 
	laying down on the bed that I made him stop. <i>&quot;Is something wrong?&quot;</i> He 
	asked me. <i>&quot;I'm sorry Thomas,&quot;</i> I said while sitting up. <i>&quot;I have a 
	boyfriend. I should go.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">As I was headed for the door he said, <i>
	&quot;Wait Rebecca, you obviously came here for a reason.&quot;</i> I was too 
	embarrassed now to ask him to try to get me a pass to the 'Left Wing.' I 
	just hoped that Jerry would come through. I told him the reason I came to 
	his room was because I was wondering if he knew anything about Heather. <i>
	&quot;Oh, that chick with the bright blonde hair,&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;Yea, I saw 
	her leave here last night. She's pretty strange. She's always hanging out 
	with that older guy, Hans. She never talks to me. I think she might be 
	afraid of a brother, you know. Why? You know her?&quot;</i> I told Thomas that I 
	thought I saw her working somewhere else. And now I saw her here. He told me 
	that a lot of people have been leaving here acting strange then come back 
	like nothing ever happened. <i>&quot;It's like they don't know where they were or 
	what they did.&quot;</i> he said.</span></p>
