    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;How?...&quot; </i>was 
    all I could manage to say. One of the Agents, who was sitting on the left 
    end of the 'U' shaped booth, stood up and stood behind me and Carmen. He put 
    one of his hands on each of our backs and quietly said, <i>&quot;Now don't make a 
    scene or people will look. If they look, ... they are likely to remember us 
    if anyone were to ask. Just sit down and we'll talk.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen slid into the 
    booth first then me. After I slid in next to Carmen the Agent who was 
    standing, sat down next to me. He spoke again, <i>&quot;Now let's get 
    introductions out of the way. My name is Agent David Andrews, that man over 
    there </i>(he pointed at the other Agent)<i> is my good friend and partner 
    of thirteen years, Agent Marcus Jacobs.&quot;</i>&nbsp; Agent Jacobs nodded his head 
    once as a 'Hello.' I returned the nod. Then Agent Andrews continued, <i>&quot;And 
    I am sure you are familiar with these two people.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I could hold it in no 
    longer. <i>&quot;Oh, I am so happy to see you!&quot; </i>The two unexpected guests 
    were Josh and Diego. I wanted to slide under the table and come back up next 
    to Josh, but I knew that would cause a scene.&nbsp; Carmen was sitting next to 
    Diego and they were already hugging. Agent Jacobs stood up and said, <i>
    &quot;Gentlemen...&quot;</i> Josh gave me a smile and mouthed the words 'I love you.' 
    Then he and Diego slid out of the booth and went to the bar with Agent 
    Jacobs. Agent Andrews, who seemed to be the talker of the two agents said,
    <i>&quot;We felt an obligation to contact your spouses because of the seriousness 
    of this matter. We have only told them minor details of what has happened.&quot;
    </i>He shared with us that when they contacted Josh and Diego, they told 
    them that there were 'Internal Government Issues' happening at Braintec. 
    They know that there is a 'criminal at large', (Dr. Tachikawa) but they 
    don't know who it is or what it relates to. Apparently, All they know is 
    that Carmen and I are in some sort of trouble but they don't know why or how.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;I feel it is up to 
    the two of you to let them know what is going on.&quot;</i> Agent Andrew said. <i>
    &quot;You can tell them as little or as much as you feel comfortable telling them. 
    They have both agreed to stay in our custody, not as criminals, but as...
    </i>(He paused as though he was trying to think of a good term)<i> ...'Citizen 
    Agents.' We are going to allow you to have half an hour to talk with them 
    alone. Then they will leave with another Agent waiting at a disclosed 
    location. He will arrive, pick them up and return our safehouse. Then Agent 
    Jacobs and I will discuss a plan we have set out for the two of you.&quot;</i></span></p>
