    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Dr. 
    Tachikawa has left during the night. He took a few expensive things with him. 
    Also his personal belongings are gone, even his laptop. It looks like he 
    will not return anymore. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">His sudden departure 
    led to complete tumult. When Dr. Hamilton discovered that important 
    equipment were gone, like an extraction-set, he called the police. 
    Immediately after that Steward seriously tried talking to him. He warned 
    about the power of the press and how this departure can end up in a huge 
    scandal. The papers will over-exposure the whole rumor, resulting in 
    negative consequences. Instability in a so-called controversial company 
    would not do any good to the little confidence sponsors already have. Dr. 
    Hamilton listened very carefully. He shook his head every now and then. I 
    think he appreciated the intensity of Steward’s words.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">A few minutes later 
    police arrived. Dr. Hamilton apologized. An indoor miscommunication was 
    caused by the disappearance of the equipment, he told us without moving a 
    muscle. He reassured the policemen that everything’s under control again and 
    he thanked them for their fast arrival. He walked with them to the 
    police-car. I saw for myself that they did make notes of the whole affair.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Steward asked me to 
    help him with making up a list of missing stuff. Together we walked through 
    the whole building. Dr. Tachikawa didn’t take away a lot, but the equipment 
    he took was very precious. Some M-Stores were missing too, among them the 
    one with my trip with the dog-sledge. <i>“What do you think Dr. Tachikawa is 
    up to with all the equipment?”</i> I asked Steward. <i>“You think he will 
    start his own business in </i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">
    Tokyo?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> Steward looked at me in 
    a penetrating look. <i>“It is better you don’t know anything,”</i> he 
    answered. <i>“For your own sake.”</i> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    whole afternoon questions were appearing into my head. What is Kodjiro up to? 
    Has he really gone for ever and will I perhaps never see him again? Maybe he 
    is with Jessica? And what’s the role Steward is playing? Obviously, he knows 
    more about it. Even more than Dr. Hamilton. What happens now without our 
    equipment? Fortunately we have extra copies of the instruments. Can we 
    continue the research without Dr. Tachikawa? And far more important: will I 
    still be able to get my weekly uploads?</span></p>
