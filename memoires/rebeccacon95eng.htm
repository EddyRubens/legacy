	<span style="font-family:Arial">After Sheila left, I decided to head over to 
	the uploading room. I wasn't clear if Sheila's conference was replacing the 
	upload or just delaying it.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I got there, the door was closed. This 
	was usually a sign that an upload or extraction was taking place. I waited 
	for a few minutes outside the door. I was however, a bit suprised to see 
	Adrian coming out of the room...alone. He looked at me then started walking 
	quickly down the hall. He was holding his denim jacket closed as though he 
	was hiding something under it. He was acting rather strange, especially 
	since he didn't even say 'Hello' to me. This reminded me of how strangely he 
	and Rosanne were acting the other night when I went to his room to try to 
	find out where Carmen was. They were talking about Dr. Tachikawa before I 
	entered the room. That is what made me stop. But, while I was waiting and 
	listening in the doorway they were talking to people who were not in the 
	room and calling out to Elisa (The woman who owned the bar in town) to serve 
	them up another round. At the time, I figured they were just really drunk or 
	maybe it was an inside joke, but now I wonder if they both believed they 
	were actually at the bar!</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I figured I would head to Dr. Hamilton's 
	office to see if he was there. I wasn't sure if I was still scheduled for 
	and upload. I didn't want to find Steward and ask him. I still think he is 
	creepy and do my best to avoid him. And, I already had my fill of Sheila for 
	the day.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I arrived at Dr. Hamilton's office he 
	was sitting at his desk with the door open. His reclining desk seat was 
	leaned back a bit and he had his glasses off and was holding them in his 
	left hand. His head was tilted back as he gently pinched pressure between 
	his eyes with his right fingers. I could tell he was stressed. I hated to 
	interrupt him but I needed to know what I was supposed to do. <i>&quot;Excuse me, 
	Dr. Hamilton?&quot;</i> I said as I gently knocked on the open door. He quickly 
	sat up and put on his glasses, answering, <i>&quot;Yes?...&quot; </i>Although he did 
	not know who it was, he quickly erased the stress and worry from his face. 
	He was, after all, the man in charge around here. He clearly was trying to 
	make it seem as though things were still fine.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial"><i>&quot;Oh, Rebecca...&quot;</i> He said after he 
	realized it was me. <i>&quot;I was dozing off there for a minute. I was working 
	late last night and I think it's catching up to me.&quot; </i>&nbsp;I just smiled at 
	him and said, <i>&quot;Don't worry about it. I just came here because I was 
	unclear if I was still scheduled for that upload.&quot;<br>
	&quot;You mean Sheila didn't come and speak with you?&quot;</i> He said in a suprised 
	tone. <i>&quot;Oh she did.&quot;</i> I said, <i>&quot;I was just wondering if that meant 
	that the upload was canceled. Sheila never specified one way or the other.&quot;<br>
	&quot;Oh...&quot;</i> He said. <i>Yes, I canceled it. I hope that was OK. I just 
	thought you might be a little upset with you friend gone and everything.&quot;
	</i>I just shook my head and agreed with him. My stomach was boiling with 
	anger. I really wanted to know where he learned to lie. He looked me 
	straight in the eye without even the slightest flinch, while saying that. <i>
	&quot;I'm sure I'll manage.&quot;</i> Was all I was able to get out.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Just as I was turning to leave, I changed my 
	direction and went completely into Dr. Hamilton's office. I closed the door 
	and sat down in one of the chairs he had in front of his desk. Now, I know 
	it was wrong of me, but I was so angry from all the lies that everyone was 
	telling me that I wanted to see someone else get a bit of the bad medicine.
	<i>&quot;Dr. Hamilton...&quot; </i>I started. <i>&quot;I want to be completely honest with 
	you. </i>(That was a lie)<i> I really have made some good friends here and 
	if that isn't reason enough to be here...well,... I don't&nbsp; know what is.&quot;
	</i>He looked at me sort of confused. He opened his mouth as though he was 
	getting ready to say something, but I interrupted him. <i>&quot;Now, I consider 
	you one of my friends Dr. Hamilton. You have always been kind to me and 
	helped me out. So, I am going to help you out. Last night, I went to visit 
	Adrian and Rosanne. They were acting really strange towards me so I decided 
	to just leave. That was no big deal...but today, I found Adrian in one of 
	the uploading rooms, alone. He obviously was hiding something under his 
	jacket when he left. I feel really torn about going behind Adrian's back and 
	telling you about all of this...But I think for his sake it's the right 
	thing to do.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Hamilton was distinctly angry. His face 
	turned a reddish color and his fists were clenched so tight that his 
	knuckles were white. He whispered, <i>&quot;Damn her!&quot; </i>while shaking his head 
	in disapproval. <i>&quot;Her?&quot;</i> I<i> asked him. </i>&quot;Yes!...Her!...Rosanne!...She's 
	been......&quot; Then he stopped. He knew at that moment that he crossed the line 
	and was about to divulge information that was not to be shared. <i>&quot;Thank 
	you for bringing this to my attention.&quot; </i>He said standing up and walking 
	towards me. <i>&quot;I will have Steward check the room for any missing items. 
	Your name won't be mentioned to anyone.&quot;</i> He used the same technique I 
	had with Sheila and opened the door proposing that it was time to leave. As 
	I walked past him he said he would let me know in advance when the next 
	upload would be, then he closed the door behind me. I glanced back and saw 
	him pick up the phone. I wondered if he was calling Steward, telling him to 
	go over to the uploading room to see if anything was missing. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">As I headed back to my room, I felt bad for 
	snitching on Adrian. But then again, it also felt good to have all eyes off 
	me, if only for a short time.</span></p>
