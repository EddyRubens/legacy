    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Just as I was looking at 
    the inscription on the M-Store the telephone rang. Which was strange because 
    nobody knew I was here. <i>&quot;Hi, it's Paul again. Paul Bentley,&quot; </i>said a 
    warm, friendly voice. He said the plans had changed and that I was expected 
    at the station in Osaka, tomorrow afternoon at 12.30 pm. His voice was 
    reassuring, and though I didn’t really know who he was and what he wanted 
    from me, I trusted him instinctively. <i>&quot;Have a nice rest, Sonja. You’ve 
    earned it. And bring the empty M-Store, we’ll need it..&quot;</i> We hung up, and 
    soon I fell into a deep sleep.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">The landscape shot past with a raging 
    speed, but my thoughts were elsewhere. What would be waiting for me this 
    time? Being suspicious, I’d taken an earlier train so I could get there an 
    hour earlier, to see who was coming to pick me up -and to check if I really 
    wanted to go for it. But I was also curious about Paul and his enchanting 
    voice. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">A slightly older, but not bad looking man 
    walked towards me as I got off the train. It was him. He shook my hand, 
    squeezing it softly to encourage me and he held on a bit longer than would 
    be normal. I was happy to see him, and I knew it was OK. He put a hand on my 
    shoulder and gently guided me past the busy station restaurant to a door. <i>
    &quot;Don’t worry, I have a good plan,&quot;</i> he said, as he opened the door.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none"><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Are you Sonja? I’m Adrian Young.&quot;</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    We shook hands as if we had known each other for a long time. Paul excused 
    himself. Adrian and I went to get a coffee and drank it by the coffee 
    machine, while chatting about our adventures in Portland and in Tokyo. And 
    how I played the part of double agent for Kodjiro and the Canadian, and how 
    I was supposed to kill Rosanne. I had no idea what to make of it and neither 
    did Adrian. Adrian also spoke of a Hans and Heather, who supposedly returned 
    to Portland, but I didn’t know them. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Paul came back, bringing 
    a skinny little woman with a white face. Then I recognized her: it was 
    Rosanne! My, she had changed, and she looked very tired. We embraced, and I 
    was glad that Paul brought her here as well. Thankfully Rosanne found it 
    funny when I told her she was looking at me as if I was about to kill her... 
    But Paul was in a hurry, and didn’t hesitate to unfold his plan. Rosanne and 
    Adrian were going to jump off a building wearing parachutes and, once down, 
    get an injection to go into a sort of clinical death, while an extractor was 
    going to record everything to the empty M-Store I had brought, and another 
    one of Paul’s. <i>&quot;And let’s do it right now,&quot;</i> he added.</span></p>
