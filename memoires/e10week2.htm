    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I wore my new suit when 
    I received the new test subjects and while giving them a tour through the 
    center. They all had these expectantly looks accept Harm. Harm comes from 
    New York-City and he was very nervous and stressed. I will suggest a test 
    for ADHD if this turns out to be his natural way of behaving. I can’t say 
    much about the other two men yet. One of the women, Alice Rutherford, seemed 
    to be so disinterested and passive that I loved to bring her to the left 
    wing for an operation immediately. Just to get rid of her sighing and 
    moaning. Well, maybe she was very tired through her journey to here. She 
    arrived first and I didn’t know what to do to pass the time till all the 
    others were here as well. I must give her a change.</span></p>

    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Sonja arrived as 
    last. She turned out to speak Dutch as her first language because she is 
    Flemish. She was also tired from the long flight, but I could handle all her 
    frustrations without any effort. I must be careful not to give her 
    preferential treatment because she can speak Dutch. I already noticed that I 
    tried too hard to comfort her, in case she wants to have a chat. It would be 
    terrible when this becomes noticeably for everyone. The test subjects are 
    now in their rooms. So they can unpack their suitcases and so on, before we’ll 
    have dinner together. Tomorrow they will have a busy day full of physical 
    and psychological tests. I will get a new upload tomorrow. Then I shall wear 
    my jeans again, ‘coss this panty is itching all over and felt uncomfortable.
