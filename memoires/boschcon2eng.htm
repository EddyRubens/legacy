    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Day,2.&nbsp; 
    it has been a heavy day for my brains so many questions and excercises and 
    all in english, not that that is a problem but to do and think everything in 
    english for 24 hours is something completely different than in our small 
    holland. </span><span style="font-family:
Arial">But okay, you can get used to everything except to a man (they say).
    </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">I had in the 
    netherlands when i started my carriere in the army in ’95 i have had enough 
    of these tests but this is something different. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">But i just did my best and there is not more 
    than i can do. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">But i think 
    it went well. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">But some questions are 
    very strange. They asked me at a certain point in time what i would do if 
    someone would lay out a blue circular wooden block in front of me and would 
    keep on saying it is a green pyramid. &nbsp;If i would say he is right or if i 
    would continue saying it is a blue circle. They seem to understand something 
    about the working of my brain through that. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">Well my 
    brain is perfectly fine. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">If i say so 
    myself. My wealth is okay as well, but yes i knew that already because i 
    haven’t got any diseases or broken bones or whatever. &nbsp;I’m looking forward 
    to the brain scan, i had only seen this equipment on the television until 
    now, but to see a scan of my own brains is something cool. &nbsp;And i must say 
    that it is very interesting to see your brains on the computer, and to see 
    them like slices one by one and everything has its color, quite unusual. Now 
    they have planned i believe that they will use this brain scan to see if 
    there are certain irregularities in the brain parts that are necessary for 
    the research. They also look at the development of certain areas which 
    influence your primary development of your life until now. Now they have 
    found an enlargement of the brain lobe that activates my photographic 
    memory. That didn’t surprise me because i have thought very often that i 
    have that. I can close my eyes and think of something and then I see 
    everything in front of me, then i can also read a letter or something else 
    and tell exactly how everything looks like. It seems to be just like 
    pictures for me. I assume this could possibly be of the influence of the 
    kind of implant that i might get. The doctors talked about it immediately 
    when they discovered it. First i thought that something was wrong with me 
    and that i could go home. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Because to be honest 
    it seems to be so unreal that i am here. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">And that this is al happening 
    with me. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Then you are at home and 
    suddenly you go on a journey. And then you are at the other site of the 
    world in what seems to be a private clinic with doctors and nurses, 
    psychologists, you are in the middle of the everybody’s’ picture that feels 
    very unreal. So i myself shall find it very unpleasant if it should end 
    right here. But i always intend to think positively. </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Tomorrow some other 
    psychological tests and also a hypnosis session, i have never been 
    hypnotized and i am curious if i can because not everyone seems to be able 
    to get under hypnosis. If they want to look at my first memory then i can 
    also tell them. That memory i shall never forget. That is at the nursery 
    school in haarlem in 1973 so i was then 4 years old. I was in the classroom 
    of miss belle, that was the sweetest teacher you can ever imagine a huge 
    woman aged approximately 55 or 60 years a huge grey haircut. And i remember 
    very well that i was clueing and cutting or with the clay and that it was 
    during the autumn and then we made squirrels with beads and loafs inside a 
    slice of clay attached to a cord and when it had dried we could take it home 
    and my mother hung it front of the window that i will never forget. It was 
    always nice to be at school there it was a warmth different than the warmth 
    at home and therefore i loved to go to school, i have by the way never 
    skipped school in my whole life i always find learning quite interesting. 
    But that is the first thing i can remember, i don’t know if you can go any 
    further back during hypnosis. Most likely you can because there are parts of 
    the brain activated that are normally not active, i am very curious what 
    will happen tomorrow. I hope that everything goes fine because i am a bit 
    stressed. If everything goes well i will go to the left wing tomorrow.
