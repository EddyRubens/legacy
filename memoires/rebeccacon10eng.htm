    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Earlier, while 
    standing in the hall waiting for Rosanne to continue our tour, I noticed a 
    pretty, young, Latin woman with long black hair heading towards the hall 
    where my room is. She looked very tired. I wondered if that was Carmen. Then 
    I started to wonder, if it was her, would she get the same urges I had and 
    think to shuffle through my things. I couldn't help but laugh to myself. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It turns out that 
    indeed the woman I saw earlier was Carmen. She had arrived yesterday and was 
    eager for a roommate to talk to. She is one year older than I am and we seem 
    to have a lot in common. She has a man waiting for her at her home in New 
    Jersey. His name is Diego. The only big difference between Carmen and I is, 
    she and Diego are engaged. I only dreamed about being engaged to Josh. They 
    made a pact that they could each do one crazy thing before they got married. 
    Diego skydived. She said laughing that he though she was going to bungee 
    jump. Boy was he wrong. I think Carmen and I will get along just fine.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I was brought 
    back to my room, before meeting Carmen, Rosanne said that they would be by 
    early to pick me up for testing tomorrow. Wow! That seems so soon. Since 
    Carmen was gone for such a long time, I have a feeling I should go to bed 
    early tonight. I will email Josh then go to bed.</span></p>
