    Lucas has hypnotized me again today. It was a weird experience, certainly as 
    impressive as a good upload. Lucas asked me to make some kind of documentary 
    of my childhood, viewed from a distance. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was back at school 
    and we were talking about the Second World War. We were asked to bring 
    things connected to this war, which us. Most of the children brought coupons 
    for food, some brought an article from a newspaper and Joep had a real Star 
    of David, belonging to his uncle. We all looked amazed at this yellow star. 
    I brought the little spoon from my grandmother with me. This wasn’t a 
    regular spoon. Granny gave me this spoon last week, when we spoke about the 
    war. She told me, that this spoon had saved her from starvation. When there 
    was nothing left to eat, she swapped this spoon for a bag full of. It was a 
    silver spoon, definitely worth a lot of money. After the war, she was able 
    to get her spoon back, in exchange of the same amount of potatoes.
    <span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I 
    understood how important this little spoon was and I told everyone about it 
    at school. They laughed at me and didn’t believe my story. Back home, I 
    suddenly couldn’t find the spoon. I searched for it everywhere. When I told 
    grandma, she wasn’t angry at me. It was all just a story, she told me. That 
    spoon hadn’t saved her at all. In reality, she swapped all her silver 
    cutlery for a small bag of potatoes and she had never seen it again after 
    the war. But she did find this particularly small spoon behind the stove. I 
    could clearly see how the loss of this spoon affected her. But I couldn’t 
    understand it. Why had grandma lied to me? My mother explained me later, 
    that it had been very hard for granny. She needed stories to maintain. Even 
    when the war was over. Otherwise she couldn’t deal with reality. Wouldn’t it 
    be perfect, if she had met a farmer like that? I have never fully understood. 
    You aren’t supposed to lie, are you? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: 700">I have 
    never found the last spoon and I have always felt guilty for it. Even the 
    fact that grandma lied about it. I know for sure some children stole it out 
    of my bag. Maybe they have thrown it into the water. When I told this my 
    teacher, he answered that I’m not allowed to lie. But stealing is much worse, 
    isn’t it?</span></p>
