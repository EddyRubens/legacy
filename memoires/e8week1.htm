    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-weight:700">My first extraction has 
    to be delayed because my menstruation wouldn’t stop. For some reason Dr. 
    Hamilton thinks it’s not wise to extract or upload while I’m having my 
    period. It doesn’t make a difference to me. I was really bursting with 
    impatience to have my first upload, but not for this extraction. There is 
    some curiosity of course and I do make the most divided impressions about 
    the course of such an operation. But I’m not looking forward to it. 
    Everything is going so fast; we hardly had the first uploads and now it’s 
    time for the extractions. I wouldn’t mind if it goes a bit slower. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">To be honest; I have 
    been cheating today. The little bit of red fluid that I’ve lost this morning 
    can hardly be called menstruation. It was so easy to create some spare time 
    that I couldn’t neglect the opportunity. So it was a little white lie that 
    brought me a day off for myself. I guess I’m not ready for this emotionally. 
    I find the idea that they shall extract something out of my brain far more 
    scary than when they put something in it. My memories will only be copied so 
    I won’t lose them. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">But 
    still. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">You never know if they 
    accidentally remove something permanently or if there’s something else going 
    wrong. And what will the other test subjects get to know about me if they 
    recall my memories? Dr. Steward says that I can decide for myself how much 
    memories I allow to extract, as in a normal hypnosis session. But I don’t 
    believe that. I remember the look on Dave’s face very well, when I recalled 
    his trip in the Grand Canyon </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">National Park</span><span style="font-family:Arial">. I could tell the 
    team members more about his trip than he cared for. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">This day-off went on 
    without any specialties. I have been lazy reading my book and have been to 
    the park. My menstruation flannel won’t work tomorrow so than my first 
    extraction will definitely go on. That is fine with me; I guess I will only 
    get bored if I’ve got another free day. And Jessica is finally being nice to 
    me again. I’m afraid we will never be as close as we used to be. That’s a 
    pity</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">. </span>
