    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    was sitting in the coffee lounge and I didn’t have the slightest idea how I 
    arrived there. Adrian and Sheila looked at me rather worried. <i>“Rosanne,”</i> 
    Sheila said, <i>“Can you remember what you were doing right now?”</i> I owe 
    her that answer. <i>“You were playing. You were acting as if Janice and Jane 
    were two teaspoons.” </i>I held a teaspoon in both my hands. How did they 
    get there? I got up and put the small spoons between the washing-up. I had a 
    headache and I was dying to lie down on my bed. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>“Why don’t you come 
    with me,”</i> Sheila said. <i>“I want to try and give you some more tests.”
    </i>Down-heartedly I dragged behind her. Once and for all those stupid 
    tests. I’d rather prefer they let me alone, whether or not small spoons. 
    After three tests Sheila tried another questionnaire. She asked me whether I 
    had this feeling I was somebody else. I didn’t feel like denying and told 
    her about the voices I heard now and again. She was interested right from 
    the start. She interviewed me over and over again meanwhile writing down 
    notes. I got fed up, I wanted to lie down. I was clear enough but Sheila 
    wasn’t finished with me. <i>“Wait a second!”</i> She told me that already 
    three times. I gave a deep sigh and then suddenly the bad one appeared. <i>
    “Don’t agree!”</i> it shouted inside my head. <i>“That stupid woman thinks 
    she is the boss. Just forget it!”</i> I tried to shake off the voice. 
    Without success. Sheila looked at me and examined me. <i>“Is everything 
    alright?”</i> I acknowledged. <i>“Is somebody with you at this very moment?”</i> 
    she asked in a soft voice. I nodded. <i>“Can I talk to him?”</i> I thought I 
    discovered some twinkling in her eyes. I got irritated. Obviously, it was 
    her first time to examine somebody’s second personality, or whatever name 
    you call it. I didn’t let her enjoy that. <i>“Already gone,”</i> I muttered. 
    Indeed. The bad one was nowhere to be found. <i>“Okay,”</i> Sheila said. <i>
    “Enough for today. But please promise you will visit me again tomorrow 
    morning. It will be even more important than any upload.”</i> I couldn’t 
    imagine so. I’m not sure if I will go there tomorrow or not. </span></p>
