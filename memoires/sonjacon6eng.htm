    <span style="font-family: Arial">Hugo called me again from Paris. He said 
    that he was worried, concerning our last conversation. He asked if I spoke 
    with the psychologist on a regular basis (how did he know that there is a 
    psychologist at Braintec?!!!). I told him that I didn't encounter any 
    difficulties with the treatments. But he insisted that he had noticed that I 
    wasn't completely &quot;myself&quot;.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Indeed, I am not &quot;myself&quot; lately, but that isn't so strange. In my attempt 
    to find out the truth I made an appointment with Tachikawa. His look was 
    surprised, but he agreed to meet me in the Japanese garden that afternoon. 
    He arrived fifteen minutes late, though punctual as he is, and he looked 
    absent-minded. He asked impatiently why I had to see him &quot;so urgently&quot;. I 
    told him about my dreams, and that I was worried about the &quot;strange thoughts&quot; 
    that came into my mind recently. He asked me what kind of thoughts, and I 
    told him that I knew about him and Rosanne. He smiled in a relaxed manner, 
    and said: <i>&quot;Well, that Rosanne... I think she fell in love with me, and 
    that is of course a common phenomenon, but she will get over it...&quot;</i> Then 
    I told him that I had the idea in my head that he might know my husband. <i>
    &quot;Sonja,&quot;</i> he said while cautiously looking at his hands, <i>&quot;Sonja my 
    dear... You are making things up in your mind. I will make an appointment 
    with the psychologist. This isn't a good development. I will put a temporary 
    hold on your treatment.&quot;</i> After that he took me to the pharmacy and gave 
    me two kinds of pills. <i>&quot;You will take these three times a day and this 
    one you must take now. Go and have a good and long sleep. I think that 
    you're just a little stressed out.&quot;</i> He gave me a glass of water and 
    waited until I swallowed the pill. Then he brought me to my room, and tucked 
    me in, like a child, and he waited until I fell into a deep sleep.</span></p>
