    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">On the way to Huber's, 
    Carmen commented on how she thought Adrian was flirting with me. I told her 
    he was just making conversation. <i>&quot;Rebecca, you can't even see it! He was 
    hinting for you to invite him to dinner.&quot;</i> She said. <i>&quot;Then,&quot;</i> she 
    continued, <i>&quot;you left an open ended invitation.&quot;</i> When I asked her what 
    that meant, she said I made it seem like I was interested in him. <i>&quot;I 
    thought I was just being nice.&quot;</i> I said. She just laughed and said <i>&quot;Yea 
    Becka, a little too nice!&quot;</i> I laughed. I could see she was feeling better 
    than earlier. I didn't want to spoil her mood but felt it was only fair to 
    tell her about Kaleb and Megan. I gave her a quick run down of what had 
    happened before I had woke her up. <i>&quot;Where could they be?&quot;</i> She asked.
    <i>&quot;I have no idea!&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;All I know is, we better never leave 
    each other sight. It's too weird and it's too scary.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We drove the rest of 
    the way in silence. I think we were both pondering what the future holds for 
    us. I could see Carmen rubbing her pregnant belly. I broke the silence by 
    saying, <i>&quot; I know everything will be OK after tonight!&quot;</i> Carmen just 
    looked at me. I could tell she trying hard to believe it. When we reached 
    the parking lot at Huber's, we both sat quietly for a minute. This was it. 
    The moment of truth. We were either going to go in there and find out that 
    it's all a scam, masterminded by Dr. Tachikawa, or we were really going to 
    get some serious help. <i>&quot;You ready?&quot; </i>I asked Carmen. <i>&quot;Well,..........&quot;</i> 
    she started to say. <i>&quot;Yea, me too.&quot;</i> I finished.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We got out of the car 
    and went into the restaurant. It was busy and crowded. Carmen and I were 
    both wearing jeans and a sweater.&nbsp; I looked over at Carmen and told her that 
    I felt a little underdressed to be here. <i>&quot;Yea...&quot;</i> She said. Then some 
    older woman in a horrible pant suit walked in the door behind us. She looked 
    us up and down then huffed and shook her head at us. Carmen smiled and said 
    something to her in Spanish. <i>&quot;Espero tú sufocar sobre el hueso de pavo.&quot;
    </i>The woman looked at me then at Carmen and smiled. She acted as though 
    Carmen was complimenting her. She ran her hand down the front of her ugly 
    brown flowered shirt, then went over to the Bar. I asked Carmen what she 
    said to the rude woman. <i>&quot;All I said to her was that I hope she choked on 
    a Turkey bone.&quot; </i>We both started to laugh. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The hostess came over 
    to us and asked if we were lost. <i>&quot;No,&quot; </i>I said. <i>&quot;We are meeting 
    some people here, the reservation should be under 'The Justice Party.&quot;</i> 
    She went and looked in her reservation book and then signaled for us to 
    follow her. On the way to our seats, she commented that we were the last of 
    the Party to arrive and the others were already waiting for us. She made it 
    sound like more than the two agents were there. When we got to the large 
    booth, I realized why the hostess said 'they were all waiting.' There were 
    two extra, unexpected, members to the party. When I saw the others, I looked 
    at Carmen. I could see by the look on her face, she was just as shocked as I 
    was.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
