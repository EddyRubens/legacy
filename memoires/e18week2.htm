    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>I just woke up and 
    looked for my second sock when Adelle anxiously bounced on my door. She was 
    highly enthusiastic when she stormed into my room. <i>“It was great, 
    Rosanne! I completely turned mad!”</i> It took some time before I understood 
    what she was talking about. Early this morning she had experienced her first 
    memory again. A memory of a beauty contest in which she participated with 
    her little cousin. Sort of a Miss Competition for young girls. <i>“Helen 
    definitely was the prettiest one! Oh, I was proud of her!”</i> Adelle’s 
    shrill voice went through my head. Last night I had finished a bottle of 
    vodka with Davel. However I could imagine and share her enthusiasm. ‘Coss 
    remembrances of memories are so very impressive, that’s for sure. Especially 
    when you experience your own, it looks like time-travel.</b> </span></p>

    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Very soon I will also 
    get Adelle’s memory as an upload. Maybe already this week. I’m very curious 
    about it. Such an exhibition for disguised infants I cannot imagine a bit. I 
    once saw something like that on TV and thought it childish, exaggerated 
    stuff. Unbelievable how people get motivated to participate in this. A woman 
    of fifty playing with Barbie dolls I find less absurd. Perhaps shortly I 
    will think about it differently. Then I will probably feel the same pride 
    when my cousin wins. I’m curious to know whether I feel just as much 
    enthusiasm as Adelle felt when she talked about it to me. She even danced a 
    pirouette across my room. Impossible for me to join her because of this 
    hangover. She regretted that.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">But 
    why so early in the morning, I suddenly remembered. Adelle already got her 
    upload at half past six this morning. The earliest upload I ever got was at 
    nine. Nobody told me about possible changes in time schedules. Also Adelle 
    did not get the point why she had been scheduled so early. It did not matter 
    to her<i>. “The longer the day still is, the longer I can enjoy it!”</i> she 
    said happily and skipped out of sight. At the door she turned around and 
    looked at me. <i>“Your Japanese friend really was enthusiastic. With him I 
    could celebrate this successful upload better!”</i> I desperately needed a 
    hot shower to get into real life again.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"> </span>
