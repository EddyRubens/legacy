    <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: 700">Ireland</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I am 
    early awake on this chilly winter day. The sun is just rising above the sea 
    and the tops of the Wicklow Mountains are coloured red. I decide to have a 
    lazy, long morning with a huge breakfast, then a bit of reading and after 
    that a training loop. My culinary memory is searching for the correct 
    spoiling of my taste buds. I have almost all the ingredients for a pure 
    Irish breakfast in the fridge. Bread in the toaster or I’ll make a french 
    toast. Worries for later, first I’ll sneak under my blanket again. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Banging 
    on the door. I don’t have a doorbell, a cottage in the field doesn’t need 
    one. The several small scraggy dogs seem to wait for my movements before 
    they loudly show the early visitor their displeasure. Great, I shall feed 
    you again one day... very brave are you. It aren’t my dogs. But all the 
    compartments and corners in my garden seem to give them enough shelter for 
    the night, and my ginger heart for food in the morning. A lovely life for an 
    irish dog, believe me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">When I 
    reach the door the barking has grown to a hysterical concert and I am afraid 
    that whoever it might be, that person is already on the run towards his car 
    and already half way at the mountain... back to the village. But in spite of 
    what I expected I found a young fellow. back against the wall, big cape a 
    bit protecting ... cap diagonal on his head and in spite of the cold, 
    lightly sweating. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Dr Lucas??? 
    Yes, that's me. i answer while I push away those hyperventilating creatures 
    with my foot... &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Delivery 
    for you, Urgent. Sign here please and the thumb-marked clipboard with 
    crumpled paper is pushed beneath my nose. The crowd has replaced it’s 
    attention to the open door and while I sign the paper a brave one comes in 
    the house. But when the young man leaves all these pekinese-like run as 
    japanese torpedoes after him. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I shut 
    the door and look at the cover. Overnight delivery URGENT from the USA. well 
    that seems to be important... first some tea.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">While 
    the kettle is sizzling I open the cover... a plane ticket, and a short 
    description how to find your way in ... Portland. Please be at the gates at 
    11:30. I look at the clock. 8:15 Jeeh. Those fellows are weird. How could 
    they manage that, in such a short time, in Ireland. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Okay 
    take it easy. What should I do with this? No time to call my secretary, she’ll 
    wrangle me because she has probably been out al night as usual. And when I 
    call her right now she might think it’s a proposal, or at least a suggestion...
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">My 
    girlfriend is also still asleep, but she will follow me if I dare to leave 
    without a serious farewell. So I hastily pack some things in my small 
    backpack. I put on some warm clothes and start my motor. There is sufficient 
    time I assure myself. It is only a one and a halve hour’s ride, the road is 
    dry so that makes it easier. Passport, money, credit card. A book for on the 
    plane. Tea, I want some tea, but the electric kettle has shut itself off 
    ages ago and I decide that it would take too long to heat it again. I have 
    to do without it. As quick as I can I put on my leather clothes and leave 
    towards the other site of town. Susan is still half asleep and wants me to 
    keep her company. No, I can’t, plane, 2 hours before departure, I’ll call 
    you when I’m at the airport. Love you. Kiss</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">And I 
    rush away. The road is empty. Saturday morning and with the speed of light I 
    can make it in 1 hour and 20 minutes. Not bad for this old man. There is 
    nobody at the desk so I can check in with only hand luggage without problems. 
    Shall I do some tax-free shopping. Nah, all rubbish, but I do find a nice 
    book. Men in Dirty T-shirts. intriguing title so i take it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Time 
    flies and I have hardly had a cup of tea and a cigarette when I hear the 
    boarding call. How long for Portland, actually? I will notice and I do some 
    exercises to cross the non-smoking time. It always works. Few people on the 
    747-400 so I can make it comfortable. An empty chair on both sides. This is 
    going to be fun. </span></p>
