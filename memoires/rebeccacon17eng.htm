    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I walked into Dr. 
    Hamilton's office there was an older Asian man sitting in a chair in front 
    of the desk reading through a file. <i>&quot;Rebecca,&quot;</i> Dr. Hamilton said, <i>
    &quot;I would like to introduce you to Dr. Tachikawa.&quot; </i>He stood up, shook my 
    hand and said <i>&quot;You are an important part of our research.&quot; </i>Nothing 
    like making me feel like a lab rat!&nbsp; <i>&quot;So, about Carmen...&quot; </i>I started 
    to say, when Dr. Hamilton interrupted. (He seems to be good at that, 
    interrupting) <i>&quot;Dr. Tachikawa arrived sometime during your recovery. We 
    have been discussing the 'panic attack extraction' idea. </i>( I guess they 
    have given it an official name now! )<i> We are both very excited to get 
    this project going. We are however keeping this project on a need to know 
    basis, so we trust that you will maintain a quiet disposition&quot;</i> I just 
    nodded 'yes' because I wanted him to stop talking. His voice made my head 
    ache!&nbsp; Dr. Tachikawa stood up and said, <i>&quot;Okay, we'll be seeing you soon, 
    yes?&quot;</i> He did sort of a half bow and left the room. I was annoyed and 
    wondered if he was this insincere to everyone, but my thoughts soon returned 
    to Carmen's well being.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton went 
    around behind his desk and pulled out a file. He said, <i>&quot;About your friend...I 
    know the two of you are very close and she would not mind that I share this 
    information with you. </i>(A pause...)<i> She went through the MESI surgery 
    process with no problems. </i>(Another pause...) <i>However after the 
    surgery she......well,.....she fell into a bit of a coma.&quot; &quot;What?&quot;</i>&nbsp; I 
    said. <i>&quot;What do you mean a BIT of a coma?&quot;</i> He knew I was getting upset.
    <i>&quot;She is out of it now, this morning, in fact, is when she woke up!&quot;</i> 
    He jumped in and said, <i>&quot;I feel that each body has it's own way of healing. 
    This was hers. She is under strict observation and will be for another week. 
    I will tell the other doctors to allow you to visit.&quot; &nbsp;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I feel a little better 
    knowing Carmen is okay now. I wonder if she is going to keep her implant. I 
    don't want to be stuck here with no one to talk to. I know I promised Dr. 
    Hamilton and Dr. Tachikawa I would not talk about their 'panic attack 
    extraction's,' but I trust Carmen completely! I will visit her tomorrow 
    morning. If I see Adrian I might ask him to pick me up some flowers, if he 
    goes to town. I met Adrian the day before my surgery. He mentioned how 
    exciting it is to receive a M-Store. He said an interesting M-Store is one 
    involving a UFO. Carmen said he was flirting with me but I think he was just 
    trying to make us feel welcome to the test subject living quarters. There 
    was an older woman with him. She seemed nice, but the sort the hangs out 
    with younger people as a feeble attempt to hang on to her youth. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Well, I am feeling 
    extremely worn from today's events. I am going to bed </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">early tonight. Dinner is 
    of no concern to me. All I want is sleep.</span></p>
