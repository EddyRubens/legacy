    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;Why was he asking 
    about Megan and I?&quot; </i>I said. Carmen replied, <i>&quot;Well, I wasn't sure I 
    should mention that we are in contact with Megan. So I just told him that 
    you were my roommate. He asked where you were and I just told him you were 
    out running some personal errands. He gave me something to give to you.&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She went over to her 
    bed and pulled out an opened envelope and handed it to me. <i>&quot;Sorry Becka,&quot;</i> 
    she said, <i>&quot;I couldn't wait so I opened it!&quot;</i> Once I was holding the 
    envelope I pulled out the contents. There were three things inside. There 
    was a copy of a CIA badge. It had the CIA seal logo on it, a badge number, a 
    photo, and a name, Agent David M. Andrews. There was also a business card 
    with the CIA seal logo and the agent name on the front. There was a message 
    written on the back of the card; <i>&quot;You can reach me at this number, 
    anytime any day. Agent Andrews&quot;</i> The last thing inside the envelope was a 
    letter. It was written on CIA seal logo encrested stationary. I read it out 
    loud. <i>&quot;Miss Reynolds, I realize the reason you have not responded to my 
    email is because you may not believe this to be real. Let me assure you that 
    it is. I came to the facility undercover in hopes to speak with you and two 
    other specific test subjects, in person. If you have received this letter, 
    it is because my attempt to come in contact with you has failed. Please 
    contact me as soon a possible. I would like to set up a time and place for 
    us to meet. I feel we have lots to discuss. Thank you,<br>
    Agent D.M. Andrews&quot; </i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I finally looked 
    up for the letter, Carmen said to me...<i>&quot; Rebecca, I think this is real!</i></span></p>
