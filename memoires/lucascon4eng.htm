    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
    flight was fast and with good service. The landing in Portland, with a 
    mellow temperature of 12 degrees nice, and still so early in the morning. 
    actually I don’t have any address of Braintec but I suspect someone will 
    take me up. If not, well then I will take a hotel. I have done some 
    traveling in the past, and believe me, if you survived Afghanistan in 1980 
    they have to come up with more serious trouble to get you stressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">But no 
    worries. I see some familiar glasses, well the black is very contrasting 
    with the white skin. I guess the long observations, the arctic area and the 
    winters in Holland has to be the cause for that. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">So you 
    are Rosanne? Nice to meet you. I see several reactions in her at the same 
    time and I decide to stop my observations for the sake of politeness. It is 
    not polite to look so deep into people, and still there is the NLP training 
    that diagnoses her as a strongly kinetic person. fast and skilful hands... A 
    bit stressed, and so am I. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I had 
    everything well organized, before I entered the lions cave, first to 
    overview the situation. But I had thought it would be Jessica or some other 
    responsible person to get me up. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
    Fortunately I have the excuse of smoking so we could search for a place at a 
    table. Coffee please I say and while she walks away gallantly I roll a 
    cigarette. Aah, that tastes well after a 9 hour flight and fortunately a 
    nice nap. I smell the Folgers, long time since and I see her waiting. We 
    chat for some minutes about the weather, the flight. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Tell me 
    a memory you have recalled through the module please I ask her, I want to 
    know how it works without asking directly. And she keeps on telling me. In 
    detail, just how I wanted to hear it. Not only a short note as a flat 
    postcard. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">She’s 
    somewhere else while we walk to her car. So much different than I thought 
    she would be. No chatterer. No over-enthusiastic pep-talk. Is she tired, 
    diverted or so. Too little information to come to a conclusion. i look 
    around me while we drive the I-205 to the south. I didn’t know we were so 
    close to Vancouver. At the radio some cheerful weather report, high 40-ies, 
    low 50-ies. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">In the 
    leaflet I read the following, probably most important facts about Portland&nbsp;
    </span></p>
    <ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
      <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black">
      <span style="font-family: Arial">Portland has the highest per capita 
      consumption of gourmet coffee bean in the US according to the <i>New York 
      Times</i>.&nbsp; </span></li>
      <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black">
      <span style="font-family: Arial">Portland has more microbreweries per 
      capita than any other city in world. </span></li>
      <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black">
      <span style="font-family: Arial">462 vineyards in state – 47 wineries 
      within 100 miles of Portland. </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Well 
    that is the kind of information I really needed. and in the meantime i speak 
    to Rosanne, who opens up and responses for the first time. I tell her that I 
    have lived in the Netherlands for 4 years, in Dordrecht and that draws her 
    horns out. We exchange some unimportant details and opinions of Holland, the 
    tax department and so on... and before I know it we drive at Braintec’s park 
    lane. Nicely maintained. The sun is shining and I feel cheerful and lively. 
    No tiredness from the flight. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">We are 
    heading the entrance, the glass reflexes both our figures. How different 
    will it be within two weeks. I know I will understand what’s at the other 
    site by then, experiences, maybe friends. Nothing will be the same again. 
    Every stone we turn on takes us a secret, the fantasy loses and do we truly 
    get wiser?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Enough 
    wanders, I cross the threshold......</span></p>
