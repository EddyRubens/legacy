    airport was nice.&nbsp; I told Josh all about Carrie, Bernie and the baby. Then I 
    told him about all the sites I saw. I don't know how interested he really 
    was, but he pretended to be anyway. I wanted to get all the small talk out

    they were looking for people to come and be test subjects. A particular 
    amount of money and a free trip to Portland, Oregon for testing was offered. 
    I instantly knew this was something I wanted to be involved with. It's not 
    the money or the free trip, it's something more. To experience something so
