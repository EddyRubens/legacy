    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    upload Kodjiro gave me this afternoon, took away all my doubts of morning 
    concerning his integrity. I felt like a king during this upload. At least, a 
    Very Important Person. I was taken care of in such a loving way that I 
    started to see me that way. Only the best was good enough for me.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">First of all, the 
    surroundings. The room, interior and even the cutlery were all so 
    sophisticated. Somebody was spending money like water. The food and the wine 
    were absolutely delicious, cannot remember ever have eaten something before 
    which satisfied my soul so deeply. People were laughing and drinking. I was 
    with good company. There were Geisha’s entertaining me and some other men. 
    The way they looked and behaved was so refined. The aim was perfection. 
    Tonight was complete.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    After the upload Kodjiro asked me what I had been eaten. <i>“Nothing yet,”</i> 
    I answered honestly. By now, it was already afternoon and I just came out of 
    bed. <i>“So you’ve just finished a dinner costing 3.500.000 yen and then you 
    argue that you haven’t had anything to eat!”</i> I was flabbergasted. <i>“Do 
    you mean that’s what the party on that upload had cost?” </i>Kodjiro looked 
    at me while he was laughing. <i>“For each person, yes.”</i> Immediately I 
    made a calculation. That must be $30.000!&nbsp; <i>“What you were having for 
    dinner during that upload,”</i> Kodjiro explained, <i>“is ‘Wagyû’, a 
    traditional menu served with beer-fed cows. Those cows get beer for ‘food’ 
    and get a daily massage so that their flesh taste extraordinary. And that 
    wine, one bottle of those is enough to nourish an African village for more 
    than one year. Not even mentioning the price of those Geisha’s...” </i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“Ridiculous!”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    I shouted. How on earth people can waste money just like that. They should 
    have given it to those people in Africa! <i>“Indeed,”</i> Kodjiro 
    acknowledged. <i>“And that’s why it’s a good thing people experience it 
    through an upload now. Such an upload will only cost at least one out of 
    thousand parts of the real experience and from the money not spent, we could 
    save the world. Although I expect they’d rather spend it on something else.”</i> 
    I lost the fight. I liked the beef, absolutely, and I really had a good 
    time. I wonder if my experience would have been different if I knew the 
    price beforehand. I suppose so. Strange upload. Every upload is somewhat 
    unusual, but this one is more difficult to get rid of. It got me to start 
    thinking about the consumer, the final result. Shall the future market for 
    M-Stores be the same as the group of swine enjoying the beef produced by 
    beer fed cows or shall the baker next-door also be able to taste it?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">My 
    back was shivering when I remembered what Adrian wrote me the other day. 
    Steward would make a living in the porn-industry. In what way that market 
    would compromise Dr. Tachikawa’s customers? I stopped worrying because we 
    decided to go for a bite. You cannot fill your stomach with virtual beer-cow.</span></p>
