    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">There is a lot of 
    organizing to be done to get the presentations on the road. I agreed with 
    Doctor Hamilton that I’d do a minimum of three. I made a promise and I want 
    to keep it. Actually it’s a good thing for me to be busy. This nagging about 
    my health is beginning to bore me. If I’m busy organizing presentations it’s 
    much easier for me to deal with my family and friends’ good intentions. They 
    want so much to help me. Now they can without getting on my nerves.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Patrick, my brother 
    in law, said he wanted to help me with promotion materials. When he saw the 
    pens and brochures I brought, he offered to help me by putting a Dutch 
    version together. He’s got a small print shop and enough time to do it 
    immediately. I translated the text while he scanned the pictures and 
    prepared a digital design. Then we printed it. I had a great time doing this. 
    I was taught silkscreen printing at art academy, but this is much more fun. 
    The printing process was done digitally, even up to the folding. Fantastic</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">!
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial">The end result is a knockout! I’m 
    ever so grateful to Patrick for putting in all this time and material 
    without even charging me. <i>“That’s what family is for”</i> he said. </span>
    </b></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">And what are friends 
    for? Jeanine called late yesterday evening to tell me she had enjoyed seeing 
    me again but that she felt very uncomfortable in my presence. She says I’ve 
    really changed. I emphasized that I’ve mainly come to the Netherlands to 
    give these presentations. Why did I say that? Why do I shut myself off from 
    the few people who have my best interests at heart? I feel like I’m 
    ungrateful and I’m afraid I might be abusing their good intentions. That’s 
    exactly what I’m doing with Jeanine. When she talked about our appointment 
    for tomorrow and told me that there’s a sort of fair at the university where 
    she works (all stuff to do with science) I asked her if that would be a good 
    place where I could have my first presentation. She had some objections but 
    I waved those away. After that she said she’d arrange it for me. </span></p>
