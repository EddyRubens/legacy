    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">With that news so 
    early in the morning, I was clueless with how to spend my time. Usually when 
    I had some free time, Carmen and I would go to town to do some shopping or 
    we would just get some coffee and hang out. Since she is not speaking to me, 
    I will have to spend the day with myself.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I figured I would walk 
    around the facility, something I hadn't done in a while. This was usually 
    how I kept up on the gossip around here. It didn't take long, after I got my 
    giant Chocolate, Chocolate Chip Muffin from the vending machine, that I over 
    heard some good gossip. I saw Rosanne and Sheila talking. They mentioned how 
    Kathy was going to have her implant removed. I guess that was all the 
    commotion yesterday with Kathy freaking out. That also explains why Dr. 
    Hamilton was unable to do my upload this morning. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">They were walking 
    towards Sheila's office talking. I quietly walked behind them trying to hear 
    what was going on. I over heard a few things. Something about Dr. Tachikawa. 
    Rosanne inquired where he was. Sheila said something sort of snotty. 
    Something along the lines of, <i>&quot;Like you don't know!&quot;</i> But remarks like 
    that are to be expected from her. They entered Sheila's office and forgot to 
    close the door. Of course I was really listening in on the conversation, not 
    admiring the painting on the wall in the hallway. (This was a good cover-up 
    tactic I like to use while listening in on conversations- 'Photo or Painting 
    Admiring') Sheila was telling Rosanne how Dr. Hamilton was worried because 
    Dr. Tachikawa was missing for the week. Also, something about how they 
    thought Rosanne went with him because she was missing too. The last thing I 
    heard was Sheila telling Rosanne not to trust Dr. Tachikawa.&nbsp; I had to walk 
    away after that comment because I saw Steward coming.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Hmmm...Seems like 
    there is more going on around here than I was aware of. I know Dr. Hamilton 
    already warned me about Dr. Tachikawa, but I thought it might be a male ego 
    thing. Now Sheila is warning Rosanne to stay away from him. I'm unsure how 
    to handle all this information. If there is so much animosity between Dr. 
    Hamilton and Dr. Tachikawa, I wonder why they are keeping Tachikawa around. 
    Maybe it's all for financial purposes! I hate that feeling I get in my 
    stomach when bad news is floating around. </span>
