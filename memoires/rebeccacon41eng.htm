    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I don't know 
    what Dr. Hamilton was thinking! I can't believe how far is he willing to let 
    things go. Let me share what happened.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I went to his 
    office as I was asked to do in the note. Nobody was there. There was however 
    another note on the door instructing me to go to a part of the facility that 
    I had never been to before. Test subjects were not allowed there without 
    specific instruction. I went down the stairs at the end of the hall, which 
    was in the right corridor of the Left Wing. At the Bottom of the stairwell 
    was the very large security nurse which the test subject nicknamed 'Shrimp.' 
    He asked to see my clearance. I only had the note Dr. Hamilton had left on 
    his office door. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial"><i>&quot;Oh, so 
    your Rebecca!&quot; </i>He said as he while chuckling. <i>&quot;Down the hall and make 
    a left when you come to the green door. Then head on in!&quot;</i> His laugh made 
    me nervous to begin with. I should have known to turn back, but that would 
    have only created suspicion! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">When I 
    reached the green door I went in to find Dr. Hamilton, Sheila (who was 
    wearing a specific diamond bracelet), and Dr. Tachikawa waiting for me. I 
    could barley stand to even look at Dr. Tachikawa. Dr. Tachikawa said that he 
    arranged an interesting experiment for me. He continued to say how excited 
    he was about it and that I was an &quot;enormous bonus&quot; to him. I looked at Dr. 
    Hamilton and Sheila. They both looked shocked at what Dr. Tachikawa had said.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Anyhow, Dr. 
    Hamilton explained that Dr. Tachikawa was going to attach a special clip to 
    my MESI implant. He said it was going to register happiness, joy, or any 'other' 
    feeling I should have during the experiment. It all sounded simple, but I 
    knew there would be more to it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Then he 
    walked me into a dark room. It was more of a chamber. The entire thing 
    appeared to be made of metal and it had a locking door. As I walked in with 
    Dr. Hamilton, all I could see was a chair. He told me to sit in the chair 
    and relax. Dr. Tachikawa stuck his head in and said with a chuckle, <i>&quot;Now 
    when the lights come on, don't be afraid to show your true emotions.&quot; </i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">My stomach 
    was turning upside down as Dr. Hamilton turned to walk out. He took one last 
    glance at me before he closed and locked the door. When he did, he whispered 
    the words <i>&quot;I'm Sorry!&quot;</i> Then the door was closed and I could hear it 
    lock. I was so scared that I started to cry. Then I yelled for Dr. Hamilton 
    to please let me out. I could hear Dr. Hamilton and Dr. Tachikawa yelling. 
    It sounded like arguing. Then it happened. The lights came on.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">The entire 
    Chamber was packed with demon and monster looking marionettes. And there 
    were scary wax statues of people. There was even some device which flung the 
    small ones at me. Then the lights turned into strobe lights and I could only 
    catch a half a second glimpse at them before the lights would flash again. I 
    was screaming and crying for someone to let me out. I was even calling out 
    Josh's name though I knew he would never hear me. The last thing I remember 
    was falling to the ground in a state of panic. I couldn't move. This may 
    sound funny to anyone who doesn't share the phobia that I have, but it was
    </span><span lang="NL" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">
    horrifying!</span></p>
