    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Sheila looked very 
    seriously at me and she motioned me to come and sit down.&nbsp; A completely 
    different sort of test-psychologist than Jessica, I thought, while I was 
    observing the corners of her mouth hanging down. I felt as if somebody had 
    called me on the spot. And maybe it was true for she started talking about 
    the big mess I had made in the coffee-room. <i>“And last week police came to 
    see you because you have beaten up the place at somebody’s home!”</i> I was 
    shocked. Sonja had told me this earlier but I assumed that it was all a 
    joke. “<i>Anyway, Rosanne,”</i> Sheila continued, <i>“I can only observe for 
    now that you have a lot of angry attacks lately. We’ll have to stop that 
    right now.” </i>She was right but if she had the slightest notion to hear me 
    out, concerning any information about the cause of all this, she is wrong. 
    No word about Kodjiro.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">She 
    did not even ask about it. Maybe she wasn’t such a bad psychologist after 
    all. She did wanted to know if I had problems in finding control over myself. 
    I had no secrets about that. Long ago, when I attended primary school, I did 
    have those moods indeed. A boy used to sit in front of me, irritating me 
    with his self-made small doll made out of a broken pen and a cork, again and 
    again. He danced with it on my small table. <i>“Tulu-tulu-tululu,” </i>he 
    teased. I ignored him at the time. But now it was too much. How childish 
    thing to do. I stood up and pushed the bottom part of the chair into his 
    face. This chair had just one single metal leg which was divided into three 
    parts. The metal touched his mouth and a small part of his tooth broke and 
    came off. During that time they called me a witch. Not really to tease me. I 
    think they respected me in a way whenever I went through those angry moods. 
    Anyway, they left me alone. Much later, in high school, I went through it 
    all over again. The girl next to me was irritating me again with her 
    childish manners and I hit her which caused a bleeding nose. I think I cried 
    even more than she did.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Sheila was busy 
    writing when I told her this. <i>“It is not a good thing when those angry 
    attacks return.”</i> she said. <i>“I have a feeling that during that time 
    you taught yourself to keep yourself under control. Due to whatever reason 
    you seem to got rid of those restraints. I do not see any connection between 
    the implant or with the uploads. I do think that you are going through much 
    stress lately. That’s why I will prescribe tranquillizers for you.”</i> I 
    left her room with a bottle of pills. I still do not know whether I’ll take 
    them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
