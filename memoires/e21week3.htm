    Frank, Adelle’s ex, came by visiting us today. He was accompanied by a dog. 
    A little grey monster wagging his tail and barking out loud, jumping into 
    her arms. Adelle told me later that she thought she owned this animal being 
    hers. But her ex possessed this dog already before they fell in love. The 
    dog is called Dinky because her ex is a collector of Dinky Toys. What a 
    nuisance, I thought for a moment, but I remembered the toddler-contest and 
    immediately forgot this whole idea. When Frank and Adelle got divorced, he 
    took the dog with him and she could stay in the house.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">How happy she was to 
    see Dinky again.&nbsp; <i>“Dinky, oh Dinky, Dinky,”</i> Adelle said hugging the 
    animal, that managed licking her head all over. She was sorry Frank could 
    only stay for just a moment. He was in the neighborhood visiting some 
    relatives and couldn’t stay any longer. He promised to come again very soon. 
    He would take her out for dinner then. He hardly left ten minutes ago when 
    there was this need for chocolate again. I wonder if Adelle can compensate 
    all difficult moments by eating chocolate.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">On our way back from 
    buying chocolates Adelle told me that she would like to recall a memory 
    related to times spent with Frank. Later that afternoon she had an 
    appointment for an extraction and was looking desperately for such a 
    beautiful moment. I didn’t think it was such a wise idea. <i>“Isn’t 
    chocolate the solution?”</i> She looked surprised when I asked her about it. 
    Then she laughed. <i>“Ah, well, you know,”</i> she said, <i>“I do not see 
    any harm in experiencing good things in my life again!” “No,” </i>I answered,
    <i>“I don’t mind either. I think it is the most important reason for all of 
    us to stay here. Although your abrupt desire for chocolate made me think 
    something is going on here. You can’t fool me that this dog is causing the 
    problem.”</i> Adelle gave a sigh. <i>“You are right, good try. Times have 
    changed and will never be the same again. How desperately I wanted it to be. 
    But right now I have a chance to look back for a moment! I would regret it 
    deeply if I don’t take this opportunity! If only for a few seconds…”</i> I 
    could not advise Adelle in this matter. <i>“I still do not think you should, 
    Adelle,”</i> I said when we got out of the car. <i>“An upload is no therapy!”</i> 
    But she was already inside the building. </span></p>
