	<span style="font-family:Arial">When we reached the third level, the 'Excutive-Club 
	Floor,' Carmen had to lean against the wall for a moment. She said she was 
	feeling winded and a little lightheaded. Diego was very concerned and asked 
	her to sit down on the leathery cushioned bench. She insisted that she was 
	fine. <i>&quot;It's just because I'm tired and hungry.&quot;</i> She said. As we 
	walked down the hall, Diego never took his arms from Carmen's waist. It was 
	obvious that he had so much love for her. I gave Josh's hand a little 
	squeeze. He gripped my hand just a little bit tighter. I knew it was a small 
	jester for him as a way to say 'I love you.'</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">We finally reached the room, Suite 103. It 
	was very near the end of the hall. Josh pointed to the door at the end of 
	the hall which read Suite 105. <i>&quot;That is the room Diego and I are in. And 
	you see the door right there, </i>(he pointed at Suite 101)<i> that is the 
	room where the agents sleep. They arranged to have this middle room as sort 
	of a conference and group planning area.&quot;</i> Josh said. Diego took out a 
	card key and handed it to Josh. I think he didn't want to take his arms from 
	Carmen. Josh opened the door and Diego and Carmen entered first. I stopped 
	Josh before we entered and whispered to him, <i>&quot;Does Diego know about the 
	baby?&quot; </i>He looked at me with raised eyebrows and said, <i>&quot;I swear 
	Rebecca,... It wasn't me. It was Agent Andrews. He was talking about this 
	surgeon who could remove these things in your heads. Then he said something 
	about Carmen being a sensitive patient because of the baby and the 
	circumstance that go with it.&quot; <br>
	&quot;What did Diego say?&quot;</i> I asked. <i>&quot;He was in shock but he's not mad. He 
	just wants it all to go back to normal, like me.&quot;</i> Josh said. Then he 
	nudged me so that I would enter the room.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Diego already had Carmen sitting down with a 
	glass of ice water in her hands. He was reading her some of the food items 
	from the guest store. I couldn't help but notice all the electronic 
	equipment when I entered the room. I had no idea what the majority of it was 
	used for. It was on all the tables with colorful wires connecting them 
	together. There were maps and photos taped to the framed artworks hanging on 
	the walls. It didn't even look like a hotel suite any longer. More like a 
	mini headquarters of some kind. <i>&quot;Well, being that you ladies have arrived 
	early, I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of this time and 
	order some dinner. Then I will inform you of the arrangements we have made 
	for the both of you.&quot; </i>Agent Andrews said. Agent Jacobs was sitting in a 
	chair with large earphones on his ears and some wires in his hands. He 
	didn't say anything. He just fiddled with the wires he was holding.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I took a step forward and said to Agent 
	Andrews, <i>&quot;I would love to get something to eat, but&nbsp; we have some new and 
	very serious information that I think you should know about.&quot; </i>I 
	explained about the email I received from Megan. How it mentioned Kaleb. I 
	was so proud to tell the agents that Kaleb left on his own to help Megan. 
	(More than they planned to do) I should have known that Agent Andrews would 
	have something negative to say. <i>&quot;You received this information threw an 
	email?&quot;</i> He said in a condescending tone. <i>&quot;How can you be certain that 
	it was Megan who actually sent it to you? </i></span>
	<span style="font-family: Arial; font-style: italic">Right now all of this 
	is just speculation until we have positive proof as to what your saying.&quot;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I was trying to be so strong and brave 
	through all this but the remark he gave was like someone jamming a sword 
	through my heart. I felt tears swell in my eyes and I had to leave the room. 
	Josh followed me into the hall. I saw Carmen from the corner of my eye. She 
	was trying to follow me out to the hall, as well. Diego was pleading for her 
	to stay seated and rest. I turned to her and gave her a wink. I wanted her 
	to know that I was fine. Besides, Josh was here and somehow his presence was 
	more than enough to make the tears go away. I explained to Josh that Megan 
	was a friend of mine. I told him that I realize that I haven't known her as 
	long as Carmen, and for sure we were not as close. But, she still was my 
	friend and it hurt that the agents seemed unwilling to help. <i>&quot;Why is it 
	that every time I mention Megan, the agents seem so unresponsive?&quot;</i> I 
	asked him. <i>&quot;Does it have something to do with who her father is?&quot;<br>
	&quot;I don't know Baby, but, we'll find a way to get her some help.&quot;</i> Josh 
	said as he put his arms around me. <i>&quot;Right now you are the only priority&quot;<br>
	&quot;They showed concern for Kaleb though...&quot;</i> I continued, Maybe because he 
	is one of their own. You know, obligations to the CIA code of honor.&quot;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Josh smiled and gave me a short but sweet 
	kiss. It was enough to throw off my train of thought. </span>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I stopped blabbering and 
	agreed to get something to eat. Maybe some food will give me some well 
	needed energy.</span></p>
