    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I shall tell you about 
    my first memory. I was a bit nervous and I was connected to a huge computer 
    with electric wires. As a kid I have been very scared for the dentist. That 
    wasn’t funny and absolutely not something I would like to share with you 
    folks. Well, it was the same kind of chair and I had to sit in it. It was a 
    bit scary. But it was happened in just a second. It kept me busy for hours.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    was a memory from a boat excursion. Not as exiting as the one Adrian spoke 
    about but rather boring. With a round-trip boat I sailed on a river inside a 
    mountain landscape. Perfectly comfortable and relax. Then I suddenly saw the 
    strangest things. I saw a bird of prey from very close by and.......... a 
    pin-up girl. The sexgirl didn’t look like the girl inside nowadays magazines 
    but from ages ago. As the variety theater with all feathers. And then I 
    puffed further on the round-trip boat full of elderly people as if nothing 
    happened. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">We have talked about 
    it for ages. It turned out to be one of Steward’s memories and he said that 
    these flits images definitely weren’t his. No, of course not. So now they 
    think that they came straight out of my unconsciousness. Yeh, that will be 
    it. What do I have to do with erotic dancers, from a time when I was still 
    wearing napkins? And what does that has to do with that bird of prey? 
    Besides that it was a very stimulating experience. I want some more as soon 
    as possible.</span></p>
