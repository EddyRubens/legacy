    five hours to organize the facilities although I managed to cook inside the

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
Arial">I found some cooking equipment in the relaxation room. The sight of this 
    dusty material fancied me to go cooking. Although I had searched through the 
    whole building, I couldn’t find any pots or pans. There had been one pan, 
    once. Unfortunately they’d thrown it away when it was scorched. These 
    doctors are certainly very smart but it’s obvious that they don’t know how 
    to cook a meal. I bought some pans and all that’s necessary to prepare 
    something tasty. It turned out to be a Danish apple soup and a vegetarian 
    rötti. A strange combination, I know, but those were the two things I was 
    dying to taste. My colleagues gave me a strange look when they saw me 
    cooking. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
Arial"><i>“Are you building that up from scratch?” “Why don’t you come with us 
    to eat downtown, that’s much easier!” “Why are you doing that? Is the 
    microwave out of order?”</i> They were also concerned about the safety, 
    because there was no cooker hood. I placed the equipment in front of an open 
    window and explained that the smoking alarm would have gone off thousand 
    times already if it was really so sensitive. My colleagues smoke more than 
    ten singing tea kettles at a time. In spite of all the amazement and resists 
    there were lots of volunteers to taste it. Eventually I had cooked too 
    little. It was nice to cook and perhaps even nicer to eat something I cooked 
    myself. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">I’m sure I will do
