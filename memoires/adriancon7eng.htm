    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Rosanne came to get me 
    at the end of the day. She had to tear me loose from my computer. The 
    Christmas dinner would start any time. I wasn’t in the mood at all, but a 
    bit of social life has to be done as well. In front of that plastic tree it 
    became a happy one after all. Some kind of an expedition team with a mission 
    far away from home. Developer’s codes whirled through my mind while we were 
    eating. The routines, subroutines and objects bounced through my thoughts. I 
    knew exactly how I had to finish it tomorrow morning. Because it would work! 
    Anyway, this was the aha... ..<font size="2">(first thing tomorrow morning is to ask dr. 
    Hamilton for a raise.)</font>&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After dinner we became 
    rather cheerful. There was real scottish whisky, especially for me! They had 
    thought of everything. And of course I became a bit drunk. I was chatting 
    with Rosanne, who behaved like a real hostess. She talked to everyone. That 
    is part of her new function as an assistant and right now she was practicing 
    a bit. But when we started to talk about Greenland she couldn’t play this 
    role. She became more quiet and calm. And she talked about her life there. 
    The time she had spent there will stay in her mind forever. That is obvious. 
    I know that kind of atmosphere. In Scotland, where I live, winter very cold 
    and sometimes quiet as well. A bit of the island feeling. The little town at 
    the sea with the miniscule harbour which runs dry by low-tide. The wide view 
    across the bay and the houses and the sheds with corrugated iron roofs, a 
    bit rusty caused by salt water. And the low light during winter months.  </span> </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Her stories and memories from Greenland brought me back home in my mind. I 
    became a bit sentimental. Or was I homesick. I told her how beautiful Elgin 
    is. And about my life there. That I teach at the smallest highschool in the 
    area. That I knew everyone in the wide surroundings of my house. It was nice 
    to talk with Rosanne about my home, but later the atmosphere changed. She 
    started to interrogate me about my download of her trip on the sledge. But 
    she wasn’t clear in what she wanted to know. I kept it that way and I have 
    said to her that it was a wonderful trip. Because it was! By the way, if 
    Steward still has not heard of Stig, there might have gone something wrong 
    during his upload.</span></p>
