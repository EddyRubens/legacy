    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    went along with Jessica to San Francisco for the weekend. It was just 
    fantastic. Saturday night there was a festival in a complex of auditoriums. 
    There were about twenty bands and going from hall to hall you could always 
    find something good. I thought one band that mixed opera singing with trendy 
    house music were tremendous. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Best concert in years. 
    A constant thumping rhythm layered with incredibly melodious vocals. The 
    atmosphere was great. Before me was a guy with a chicken on his back. It was 
    one of those rucksack things. Its little head bobbed up and down with the 
    rhythm. <i>‘Well, if a chicken can dance, so can I’</i> I thought to myself. 
    During all the swinging I suddenly realized what I wanted. I’m going to sing 
    in a band too. First I’ll take some singing lessons of course. But then I’ll 
    be just as good as this. I’ll tour the world with my band and perform in 
    every major city. I won’t become so famous that I’ll be recognized on the 
    streets, because that would be awful. But I will be financially independent 
    and be able to buy whatever I like. It doesn’t have to be much. It’s no good 
    having lot’s of things when you’re always traveling around the world. But a 
    chicken like the one before me, for instance, would be handy. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Being away for the 
    weekend has done me a lot of good. I have indulged myself completely. Being 
    back at Braintec is ever more boring though. Even though the research is 
    fascinating and the work diverse, I get stuck in a rut real easy. The crazy 
    San Francisco nightlife beats everything. At Braintec almost everyone is 
    deadly boring. All they can talk about is technical details. And the other 
    test subjects only talk about their past or the far future. There doesn’t 
    seem to be anything happening in between for them. This type of research 
    will result in that sort of thing of course, but it’s still boring. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">If I 
    tour with a band that won’t be my lot. As soon as the performances become 
    routine I will hit the studio and when recording becomes tedious I’ll start 
    touring around the world again. The people I’ll meet won’t be so boring. 
    Can’t think of a better life, really. </span></p>
