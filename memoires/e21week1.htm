    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Kathy’s 
    implant has been removed without Dr. Tachikawa’s presence. At this moment 
    she is recovering from the operation. This morning when I visited her she 
    was feeling alright. Obviously, she needs a couple of days to recover but 
    she told me she felt fine already. I think she is mostly relieved. Glad that 
    her implant is no longer in her head. <i>“I’m satisfied with my own memories 
    for the time being,”</i> she told me. Nothing wrong with the idea staying in 
    bed for a couple of days. Not only to recover from the operation but most of 
    all from the time spent here at Braintec. She will miss a lot of things but 
    at least just as many things she would want to get rid of. Kathy has never 
    been so straightforward with me before. Maybe she feels free now.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">It 
    doesn’t matter to Kathy if she can never get an upload again. She is really 
    fed up. I wouldn’t miss it, not for love or money. I’m almost dying to get 
    another one. Today I will receive a memory of Lucas, tomorrow I get an 
    extraction myself and the day after tomorrow I get one from Adelle. As an 
    assistant test subject I know beforehand what sort of memories they are. 
    Actually I like that. Enough surprises. ‘Coss when you go to the cinema you 
    also would like to know what’s showing. It would be even better whenever I 
    could decide which upload I can get on which moment. <i>“Hmm, today I’m a 
    bit melancholic. Let me upload Adelle’s memory.”&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The day 
    after tomorrow Dr. Tachikawa will be back from Tokyo. I’m anxious to know 
    what he thinks of Kathy’s developments. I wouldn’t be surprised if it all 
    didn’t matter to him. It seems that he is only interested in his own stuff. 
    All attention goes to his developments. Just the way it has always been.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">I hope he 
    brings good memories, straight from Japan. I have never been in Japan. Tokyo 
    is one of the places I would really like to visit. I think it will be great 
    getting another upload in a surrounding such as the Japanese garden very 
    soon. Maybe I should suggest it to him when he returns. If he is too busy or 
    he is not in the mood, he will surely deny again that we have been there 
    before. And he will definitely tell me that I’m imaging things. I’m sure 
    that illegal M-Stores are easy to get. I’m afraid so. Even Steward would 
    have some. Sally saw it all. She told me he received a mysterious parcel. 
    What else could that be apart from M-Stores?</span></p>
