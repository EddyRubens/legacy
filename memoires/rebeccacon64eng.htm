    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I woke up this 
    morning, I realized that last night was the best sleep I had had in months. 
    Was it because so much had happened yesterday? Meeting Kaleb and finding out 
    his story, the straining upload, finding Megan and Kaleb missing, then the 
    excitement of seeing Josh, and the whole meeting with the agents. I guess 
    the day was full of exhausting events.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I took a quick shower 
    and did my best to get ready and not wake Carmen. If I felt that exhausted 
    she must have been feeling it times two. I decided to let her sleep for a 
    while. I always managed to find a way to keep busy by myself. When walking 
    down the hall, I noticed quite a commotion happening with Dr. Hamilton, 
    Steward, and Rosanne. I made my way a little closer to see if I could find 
    out what was going on.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Dr. Hamilton had 
    apparently just gotten off the phone with the police. Steward seemed frantic. 
    He took Dr. Hamilton aside and started talking to him. I couldn't catch 
    everything he was saying. All I managed to hear was something about the 
    press and then he mentioned a 'scandal.' </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">This worried me. Had 
    something bad happened? Was it Megan or Kaleb? I know that Kasey died here, 
    did one of them share the same fate? Or, did Dr. Hamilton find out that 
    Carmen and I are helping the CIA. I never questioned if Dr. Hamilton was a 
    partner in crime. Was he helping Dr. Tachikawa hide here? He would have 
    every reason to. Even though Dr. Tachikawa was an Ass, he was the man behind 
    the money. My stomach was turning.I decided it would be best to stay out of 
    site until I knew for sure what was </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">really going on.</span></p>
