    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I just got 
    back from receiving my first upload. Dr. Hamilton, Sheila, and Mark Steward 
    were all there. Sheila stood over by the door most of the time. I felt sort 
    of bad going off the way I did. I think I will write her an apology letter 
    tonight and stick it under her office door. That way I can explain myself 
    without having to interpret how I feel about it! (Rolling my eyes!)&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Hamilton 
    explained that in the beginning, they use to start the test subjects out 
    with an image, such as a glass, a vase, or a flower. Now that they have done 
    lots of tests, they know these images worked fine, but were rather dull. He 
    asked if I would like to start with an image or a memory upload. I of course, 
    choose the upload.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I was told to 
    lay back in the chair and relax my mind. The lights were dimmed and I closed 
    my eyes and waited. I felt the M-Store server being put in place and then 
    heard a small click.Moments after that, I suddenly appeared on the side of 
    an airplane runway. I remember feeling my heart pounding in my chest. It was 
    the feeling of excitement! I was watching these huge jets fly across the sky. 
    They came so low to the ground that I felt like I could grab the wing of one 
    of them and fly along with it! &quot;Here it comes again!&quot; I thought excitedly. 
    The ground started to rumble beneath my feet, then an extremely loud noise 
    and finally a huge gust of wind and then the jet was gone. After it flew way 
    up into the air, my eyes lost sight of it. No matter, I like when it zooms 
    by where I am standing. I will wait for it again!Then it was over.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">The light 
    were brightened as I opened my eyes, I knew I had a huge smile across my 
    face. This was unbelievable! I don't really like jets or planes, but right 
    now I love them! I want to feel the rumble beneath my feet again! I gave my 
    entire recall of this memory to Dr. Hamilton and Sheila. I now can 
    understand the term Dr. Hamilton used the other day, 'upload junkies.' This 
    is so exciting and so amazing all at the same time. I want to experience it 
    over and over! I wondered who extracted such an exhilarating memory. </span>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">When I told 
    Carmen about the upload, I didn't get the reaction I thought I would. She 
    just sort of smiled and said, <i>&quot;That's great!&quot;</i> I think she must be 
    feeling left out. I will talk to Dr. Hamilton tomorrow to see when she can 
    get her first upload. I know her recovery is different from mine, and her 
    experiences here are really none of my business, but she is my good friend, 
    and I want her to be smiling, too!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">I should go. 
    I need to write a letter to Sheila before I go to bed. I am not the least 
    bit tired after the upload. I feel like I could run a mile. Maybe I will go 
    see if anyone is in the communion-room after I drop off Sheila's letter. 
    Carmen doesn't seem to be up to chatting right now. Maybe someone else is. I 
    think I will ask Carmen if she would like to come. It's bad enough she 
    already feels left out. I wouldn't want to make it worse.</span></p>
