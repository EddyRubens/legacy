    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    just woke up when Kodjiro was sitting at the foot of my bed. That man really 
    got up early! The clock just struck eight when he appeared in his costume. 
    Still tired I rubbed my eyes and sat up straight in bed. <i>“Time for an 
    extraction,”</i> Kodjiro said. I looked at him surprisingly. <i>“I want to 
    register your memory from yesterday spent with the seagulls. In exchange, 
    you will get another upload this afternoon.”</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was awake in just a 
    second. Of course I wanted to get such an upload! I prefer it here, now and 
    fast, instead of waiting until this afternoon. Although I didn’t fancy an 
    extraction at all. I just woke up! It felt as if I was in Portland again. 
    Responsibilities are coming back in return. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I couldn’t think about 
    it any longer. Kodjiro was ready with his equipment. Also the size was much 
    smaller than the last time. Not as small as the portable upload-set, but it 
    could easily fit into a briefcase. He used a small laptop to measure my 
    brain-wavelength. I was permitted to lie down trying to relax. It wasn’t 
    difficult to recall the splendid afternoon we shared yesterday. Kodjiro was 
    satisfied. According to myself the extraction was completed successfully. He 
    packed all equipment and told me he would pick me up around one o’clock this 
    afternoon. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Until that time I 
    stayed in bed. Slept for a long time, apparently I was still very tired. 
    However, I also have been thinking about everything so far. Again a 
    boat-trip. As far as I know, it is already the third registered boat-trip on 
    M-Store. Adventures in a rubber boat on the Atlantic Ocean, Steward’s trip 
    on the river with the pinup-girls which had to be destroyed, and now this 
    one of myself. Obviously, I’m not the only one who loves to sail. On water 
    you can relax. No restraints and you are what you really feel. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Suddenly I stood up. That bastard! That arrant Japanese didn’t choose an 
    extraction of a boat-trip just like that! And the timing of the extraction, 
    no doubt, didn’t appear out of the blue! Without making me suspicious, he 
    had extracted my feelings for him! How weird. He must have noticed that 
    something else was on my mind, apart from the pleasure of the moment itself. 
    He could have asked for it, why not? I’m sure he thinks this was more 
    exciting. And who is experiencing this memory of mine? Maybe my feelings for 
    Kodjiro are sold for incredible high amounts, right at this moment!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I felt being misused. 
    Kodjiro had taken something from me which was too precious to share with 
    somebody else. The jerk! But strangely enough it also felt pleasant. When 
    the shot of adrenaline slowly worked out, I was curling around the pillow 
    thinking of Kodjiro. That man can do anything he likes with me and funny 
    enough, I even like the idea…</span></p>
