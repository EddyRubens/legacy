    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;There is so much 
    happening I don't know where to start.&quot;</i> Carmen said. <i>&quot;Jerry said that 
    he was working at the front desk when Dr. Tachikawa left last night. I think 
    he said it was about 2:00 am when his shift began. That's when Dr. Tachikawa 
    left, storming out with a whole bunch of luggage and boxes. Jerry said he 
    could see that he was really angry so he didn't say anything to him. But get 
    this...After he loaded up the car with the luggage and boxes, he came back 
    in for someone,... a girl. Jerry said he couldn't see who it was because she 
    had a jacket on with a hood. He said she looked like she was drugged or 
    something because she could barley walk. He said Dr. Tachikawa was 
    practically carrying her.&quot; &quot;Do you think that could have been Megan?&quot;</i> I 
    asked <i>&quot;I didn't know.&quot;</i> She said.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Carmen said that Jerry 
    told her that he has seen a lot of suspicious stuff lately. Jerry apparently 
    saw Dr. Tachikawa leaving with the other Psychiatrist, Jessica, awhile back. 
    Carmen said that Jerry wasn't sure if she was being forced or not because 
    they left so quickly. Then only a few days ago, Jerry saw Dr. Tachikawa 
    leaving with another woman. He said her name was Sonja. He said she also 
    looked as though she was drugged. Jerry told Carmen that Dr. Tachikawa was 
    carrying her luggage while she slowly walked along side of him, like she was 
    in a trance. <i>&quot;All of this is so strange!&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot; Why does he 
    keep taking women away from here?&quot; &quot;I don't know?&quot; </i>She said. <i>&quot;But, 
    Jerry also told me that he saw Kaleb leave!&quot; &quot;What?&quot;</i> I replied <i>&quot;When?&quot; 
    &quot;He said it was about 3:30pm, yesterday.&quot; </i></span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">Carmen said. <i>&quot;He just walked 
    out, with only a backpack. And he never came back.&quot;</i> When I asked her 
    about all of his stuff she said that Jerry saw two of the security nurses 
    boxing it all up. <i>&quot;It's all really strange, Rebecca.&quot;</i> Carmen said. <i>
    &quot;And, I'm not liking it one bit. I'm just glad that Dr. Tachikawa is gone. 
    Who knows, one of us might have been next!&quot;</i></span></p>
