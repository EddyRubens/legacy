    Yesterday I spoke with Jessica about my being homesick as well. She 
    understood and suggested that I travel to the Netherlands for a week. That 
    would give me a break and help me to affirm my roots. She says being 
    reminded of where I come from would be healthy for me right now. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In the meantime it’s 
    all been settled. Dr. Hamilton gave permission without any problems. He will 
    pay for the trip if I agree to do some promotion. We had an extensive 
    meeting about it and worked out that I could do some company presentations, 
    explain the project to groups of people. With a little luck I might find 
    some new test subjects for Braintec this way. A week seems a little too 
    short for this though. It’s going to take me at least one day to recuperate 
    from the journey because of the distance. So we’ve decided that I’ll be 
    going for two weeks. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Two 
    weeks in the Netherlands! I feel like I’m going on a holiday. They’re not 
    wasting time as usual, so I’m leaving tomorrow morning! If I don’t mind that 
    is so soon. Why would I? I love doing unexpected stuff! The butterflies hit 
    my stomach as I started packing. Next morning Dr. Tachikawa will take me to 
    the airport! </span></p>
