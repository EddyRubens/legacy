    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">This 
    time was different than the others. Maybe because this memory was on a new 
    M-Store? The upload of Adelle’s memory was very complicated so that I’m 
    still deeply impressed. Even though I am used to something like this. So 
    much stratification, so far so deep. I still get dizzy from all this. I knew 
    already before that I would get the memory of the toddler competition. My 
    expectations were double. On the one hand I was curious about Adelle’s 
    memory and moreover a new M-Store, and on the other hand I was not so much 
    impressed by this subject. It is obvious that I’m not fascinated by beauty 
    contests. Especially held for children!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After the upload I 
    seemed to wake up from a very weird dream. My perspective seemed to have 
    changed. I looked at the world from another angle, as if it was lighted in a 
    different way. More beautiful. I was pleased to see it in this way. I felt 
    myself peaceful with everything around me. I wondered, did they give me 
    drugs? I felt the music of the spheres and I could not imagine that all this 
    was completely natural. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Later, when I had discussed the upload with the team, I realized it was much 
    more complicated than I thought. Peace I felt came from Adelle. I had copied 
    her life’s experience and wisdom. Not in details, but essentially. 
    Acceptance and satisfaction with the situation and the ability to enjoy the 
    moment intensively. The beauty contest did not matter anymore. It could have 
    been a visit to the zoo, just like that.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I have decided to try 
    and keep it. For me this memory is a sort of eye-opener. A function of 
    example. I like to be that way, I like to live that way. And moreover: I 
    want to feel that way. I have not the slightest idea if that is possible, to 
    learn life’s experience in this way. The whole system learning from mistakes, 
    by trial and error, I will avoid in this way. In any case my respect for 
    Adelle has improved. I will never argue about toddler’s beauty contests. And 
    that also implies for stamp collections, railway models or knitted doll’s 
    clothes. I will never whine about them. If it was for the sake of such an 
    intensive experience as this upload gave to me, I truly wish everybody to be 
    happy with such a hobby. You will never hear any arguing sound anymore from 
    my mouth.</span></p>
