    After our night on the futon we started taking a lot of uploads. Adrian had 
    roughly about thirty carrying with him and I’m afraid we have experienced 
    all of them at least ten times. We couldn’t get enough of it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Just for one short 
    moment I left the apartment to purchase a few large bottles of coke and a 
    large stock of noodle-dishes in a small shop just round the corner. We only 
    had to add some boiling water to get something to eat. Because the room had 
    been darkened, we had no idea about time. We ate when we were hungry, slept 
    when we got tired and took an upload whenever we wanted. Especially that 
    last thing we almost did constantly.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In the beginning I was 
    afraid of the monkey-uploads. However, they were no scaring experiences but 
    the fact they were dealing with animals I found a bit weird. And afterwards 
    it gave me such a strange feeling. Moreover I was worried about the 
    punishment of those animals. According to the memories it was quite clear 
    that they lived in free nature. Apart from a few that probably came from the 
    zoo. Where are they now, those monkeys? Are their lives still worthwhile? I 
    didn’t quite understand the need of these experiments. Maybe they give those 
    animals human memories as uploads. What shall happen to them if they do so? 
    Obviously that curiosity motivated their self-interest.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Anyway, fortunately 
    Adrian also carried human memories with him. When I got fed up with that, 
    and when I saw how happily Adrian was jumping through the room, I also dared 
    trying one from his favorite small box. Indeed it was fantastic. I believe 
    I’ve never felt so much freedom before. I was carrying a baby on my tummy 
    and felt proud as a peacock. Together we jumped across the trees. I didn’t 
    feel any stress and nothing to worry about. As far as I’m concerned this 
    gorgeous moment would last forever.</span></p>
