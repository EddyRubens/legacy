    Today I saw Sonja! After going through those vague situations earlier this 
    week I simply intended to spend a peaceful day. Some shopping in town. So 
    many things to see over there! While I was strolling about the streets, she 
    suddenly pulled me into an alley. It scared me out! Until I saw her standing 
    there. I hugged her for a moment, for I was very glad to see her. Then she 
    pulled me along, to a stand of ramen. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">So many things I 
    wanted to ask her and tell her. Patiently she let me do the talking. But she 
    ignored my questions carefully by questioning me more. After that she showed 
    me a few photos on the display of a small digital camera. Did I know that 
    guy? Although it was such a small camera, the picture was clear. I 
    immediately recognized the man. It was that boring man organizing our 
    ‘meeting’ at the blood bank yesterday! I told Sonja about it and she seemed 
    pleased with my information. I also told her that I ended up there only by 
    coincidence when I just had arrived in Japan</span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">. 
    “Putting your head straight into the lion’s mouth,”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    Sonja argued. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She was rather skinny. 
    From time to time her eyes seemed to point at all directions. She didn’t 
    feel quite comfortable. What could I do to help her? She didn’t know for 
    sure. <i>“Watch that Canadian,”</i> she warned me. <i>“He is the man who 
    kidnapped me a long time ago. He is a member of the PNGO, a secret 
    organization dealing with bad intentions.”</i> I remembered her talking 
    about that earlier. I understood while I nodded my head. Might she be 
    exaggerating? Was she paranoia or was the truth an over-simplified opinion? 
    In one movement I showed her a few large banknotes. I wanted to give them to 
    her. <i>“Otherwise you end up sooner or later in a blood bank yourself,”</i> 
    I fooled while I passed on the money to her. She refused it. Did she think 
    it was polite refusing money or was she afraid to take money from me? If she 
    even doesn’t trust me anymore… </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She had enough money, 
    she said, and wanted to leave. <i>“Wait just another minute,”</i> I tried.
    <i>“I want to see you again soon. Shall we set a date?”</i> She was taken by 
    surprise through my question. She was thinking seriously and then she nodded 
    her head. <i>“No, I know where to find you when I need it. Remember very 
    well that you cannot trust that man from the West. The whole of Braintec is 
    an organization better staying out of it, even today and don’t wait until 
    tomorrow. But I realize it’s asking too much of you. See you later, Rosanne. 
    Take care!”</i> I muttered the same kind of words and saw her walking away 
    quickly. Strange girl. It was good to see her again. I like her very much.
