    About one-and-a-half hour later it all became clear to me. I met Kodjiro in 
    the corridor. This time he had an eye on me. I could easily see his joy from 
    a distance. He was in good shape just like Adelle was. As he reached me, he 
    suddenly grabbed both my upper arms. <i>“I made it, Rosanne!”</i> his eyes 
    were glittering because of all this. <i>“My new M-Store is a great success!”</i> 
    Kodjiro pinched me just a little too hard. I think it’s great he feels 
    happy, but no need that I should suffer through him? I tried to avoid 
    attention on my painful upper arms and concentrated on his shining eyes. <i>
    “Good for you! You have worked hard on it!”</i> Maybe I reminded him that 
    still a lot of work had to be done, for suddenly he let go off me. The magic 
    seemed to be interrupted. The only thing I could do was rubbing my upper 
    arms. Luckily, they were still there. <i>“This afternoon some people of the 
    press will arrive. I would like you to take care of something to eat for 
    them. Could you take care of snacks and drinks together with Adelle? Of 
    course, at the expenses of Braintec.”</i>&nbsp; I think I was looking in such a 
    way that I agreed for he thanked me and left right away. Incredible how much 
    energy that man was surrounded by! I had to shake off his enthusiasm to make 
    myself conscious of what happened. Obviously I had agreed on taking care of 
    a buffet. Where can I find it all? For how many people?</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Fortunately Adelle 
    knew exactly what he meant. She took us to a place where we could take away 
    fast foods. They even gave us table-cloths, napkins and exquisite trays. I 
    assume it smelled delicious but this smell of cauliflower almost made me 
    vomit. I could hardly stand it through yesterday’s vodka. I had to open up a 
    window quickly in order to get some fresh air. In order to excel street 
    sounds Adelle put on the radio to its maximum. <i>“Sweet dreams are made of 
    his, who am I to disagree?”</i> The Eurythmics were echoing through the car 
    and Adelle was singing from the chest. <i>“I traveled the world and the 
    seven seas, everybody is looking for something.”</i> Never saw a person who 
    is so super enthusiastic. My stomach almost made me feel sick. </span></p>
