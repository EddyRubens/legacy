	<span style="font-family:Arial">I had 2 hours before I was going to go see 
	Jerry and Thomas. I knew there was no way I was going to be able to settle 
	down and relax until I knew what was going on. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">I couldn't imaging what Jerry meant when he 
	said that Carmen was in trouble. I also wondered why Jerry and Thomas both 
	looked so worried when I went out to see them at the front counter. They 
	both had attributes for snooping (A quality I admire) but, they also had an 
	honest concern in their eyes. Jerry is good at finding out information. He's 
	one of those guys who always goofs around and throws out his quick wit. Most 
	people don't realize how smart he really is. He is so easy to open up to 
	that he gathers information from people without them even realizing it. 
	Carmen use to talk about him and said she wished she knew him back in 
	highschool. She mentioned something about having him to do her homework.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">Thomas was good at acting upon information. 
	If something had to be done in order for information to get obtained, that's 
	where Thomas stepped in. Quite a few people around here were intimidated by 
	him, but I knew that he was really a sweetheart. We actually came to 
	Braintec around the same time. He has always been very sweet to me. </span>
	</p>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jerry and Thomas became 
	friends almost instantly. They were people who you would never imagine being 
	so close. But then again, I suppose some would say the same about Carmen and 
	I.</span><p class="MsoNormal" align="right">
