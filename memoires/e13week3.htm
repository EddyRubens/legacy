    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I’m still knackered 
    but a little more open to reasoning. My mother didn’t appreciate that I’d 
    withdrawn so quickly without saying anything. I think she understood why 
    though. Jeanine apparently didn’t understand. I had just finished breakfast 
    and there she was. We haven’t seen each other for such a long time; it’s 
    hard to pick up from where we left. A few years ago I would’ve killed for 
    her. I loved her to bits. We’d call or see each other almost everyday. But 
    when I got restless about one and a half year ago our friendship weakened. 
    And then I started to travel. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Jeanine wanted to know 
    what the deal was with my implant. And not just her, my parents as well. I 
    think they’re really worried so I put them at ease as much as I could. Then 
    we talked about the old days, what we’d been through since we parted ways 
    and then we didn’t have anything left to say. We just sat there without 
    talking. Very uncomfortable. <i>“An implant might be just the thing for you, 
    Jeanine.”</i> I said, clumsily breaking the silence. Jeanine jumped up and 
    proposed to get together again the day after tomorrow. Maybe we just need 
    some more time to get back to the way things were. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    took a short walk through the neighborhood. The typical Dutch architecture 
    made me feel melancholic. The houses are all the same, terribly boring 
    looking and with no sense of space. Quite different from the way they build 
    in America. Still, I could sense my roots in those rows of houses. Back home 
    I went up the attic to get the family picture albums. I really wanted to see 
    the house where we lived when I was four. The resemblance with the 
    re-experience of my fourth birthday was striking. The perspectives were all 
    wrong but I had expected that. It was the pictures of me from that time that 
    confused me. I knew that girl; I knew exactly what went on in her mind. I 
    felt connected to her but didn’t feel like it was me. I told mum, who was 
    looking at the pictures with me, how I felt. <i>“Can’t be healthy, that 
    thing in your head,”</i> she sighed, <i>“I don’t like it one bit.”</i>
