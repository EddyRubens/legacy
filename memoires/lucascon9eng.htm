    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I have 
    passed my days with a lot of studying and also with as much listening to the 
    other test subjects as possible. But most of them are a bit hesitant about 
    being hypnotized by me. Who knows I might be a charlatan who’s just making 
    this up. And... very important hypnosis only works with the full cooperation 
    of the person.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">After 
    long pressure, and, I must confess a couple of drinks, and some compliments, 
    I get Sonja this far that she will do a session with me tomorrow. First she 
    used the word dare, but that is not enough for me. I push further... does 
    she wants to or not... finally she admits. We talk a bit about her husband, 
    al the things she experienced here and what she expects to learn from it...
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">We go 
    back quite late both to our own room... </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Tomorrow 
    morning more. What is bothering me, is that I’ve, and that’s for the first 
    time, actually planned to go further during the hypnosis than agreed. But 
    that depends on the level of trance I can arouse. All the signals show how 
    susceptible she is for hypnosis... but I had that before, and when it 
    started I rushed against a concrete wall... </span></p>
