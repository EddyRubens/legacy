    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Hugo 
    called me today. Or actually he called to Dr. Hamilton and then he asked me 
    to take over the conversation<i>. “You know better than I do how Sonja is 
    getting along,”</i> he said while he gave me the horn. It was clear that 
    Hugo worried about Sonja. <i>“Sonja sounded so much differently when I 
    called her last,”</i> he told me. <i>“Not himself.” “That I can imagine!”</i> 
    I answered. <i>“How would you feel if you discover that your lover would 
    rather prefer to get rid of you in order to sleep in somebody else’s bed?”</i> 
    Silence was heard on the other end of the line. After a while Hugo broke 
    silence by coughing. <i>“Talking about the program Sonja’s watching over 
    there with you. Is it okay?”</i> Why Sonja’s husband became so much worried 
    about her all of a sudden? It seemed to me very hypocritical. <i>“The only 
    thing that bothers her is you!”</i> I shouted to my big surprise. <i>“You 
    men have not the slightest idea what you are doing. It is really time to 
    make things happen!”</i> Hugo became quiet immediately. <i>“I just wanted to 
    know how Sonja was doing,”</i> he said confused. <i>“Can you please give my 
    regards to her and tell her that I love her?”</i> This man really irritated 
    me immensely. What did he have in mind? That he could fix things together 
    with slime?&nbsp; <i>“Why don’t you do it yourself!”</i> I answered abrupt and 
    smashed the horn. Dr. Hamilton looked at me very surprised. <i>“What is 
    going on?”</i> he asked. <i>“Some men are driving me crazy!”</i> I explained. 
    I’m glad the director could not understand Dutch.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When my anger dropped 
    a bit I looked for Sonja. She was staring out of the window in the coffee 
    room. I told her about the telephone conversation and dark clouds over her 
    head seemed to clear the sky. Slowly a smile was visible on her face. 
    “Thanks, Rosanne!” she said and turned her head again towards the window. 
    Again she was looking into the distance. With this never ending view.</span></p>
