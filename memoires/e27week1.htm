    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">When 
    I look into Kodjiro’s eyes, I don’t know what I see. Is it innocence, 
    playfulness or pure sadism? Most likely I project everything concerning him. 
    Being in love might be one big illusion. All his charms and small talk could 
    easily be based on lies and deception. Lately I have been hesitating more 
    often. The more I have him around me, the less confidence I have in him. And 
    still I feel being in love. Could it be mystery which attracts me most in 
    him? Out of reach, a relation doomed to fail? I don’t know. So many things I 
    do not know of. Too many actually. I should change that. That’s the reason 
    why I decided to follow him this morning.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">This morning, just 
    like all other days, Kodjiro got up earlier than I did. While he was taking 
    a shower, I got dressed as fast as I could. He looked at me surprisingly 
    when I was waiting in a chair, wide awake, when he came out of the bathroom.
    <i>“What are your plans for today?”</i> he asked. <i>“I would like to join 
    you, if you don’t mind,”</i> I answered indifferently. He refused my 
    proposal. Rather impossible, too difficult, too dangerous and more of that 
    kind of nonsense. I left the apartment moody and slammed the door behind me. 
    He reacted exactly how I was expecting he would. Anyhow his reaction came as 
    a shock to me. Yesterday he was so kind to me and now he doesn’t take me 
    serious again. This proved he kept me in suspense.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was hiding behind a 
    soft drinks slot machine. Like on every corner of the street, there were 
    seven 
    in-a-row. I was pretending making a telephone call and was watching the 
    front door of the apartment through the reflection of the shop-window just 
    opposite. Kodjiro came outside. He was looking to the left and to the right 
    three times and crossed the street. Fortunately it is quite busy in town 
    during this hour. That’s why it was easy walking with the crowd and 
    following him without anybody noticing it. Near the metro it became more 
    complicated. Kodjiro was much faster in passing entrance gates than I was. I 
    almost lost him out of sight. Then suddenly he looked into my direction and 
    I had to jump behind an information-sign so he couldn’t see me. I was afraid 
    to jump into the same metro-compartment. At each station I was spying for a 
    well-known face between men getting off the train. Why all Japanese look 
    alike? I had to push aside some people when I saw him disappear into the 
    crowd. Coming outside it was much easier. I knew this area, I had been here 
    before. To my great surprise I saw Kodjiro entering the building of the 
    Japanese blood bank. One and-a-half week ago I had blood taken from me here! 
    I stopped in shock. This couldn’t be coincidence.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    even got more scared when suddenly I felt one hand on my shoulder. <i>
    “Rosanne!”</i> It was the doctor who gave me that map at the time. He seemed 
    happy to see me.&nbsp; <i>“Are you walking with me?”</i> No point at all walking 
    with him. We shared the same elevator to the fifth floor. How shall Kodjiro 
    look when he would see me here? I prefered not to think about that.</span></p>
