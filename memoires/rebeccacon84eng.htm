	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I reached the main lobby, to talk with 
	Jerry at the front counter, I saw Rosanne touring a new group of test 
	subjects. It was a suprisingly small troupe with only six of them. She 
	walked passed me, purposely knocked her shoulder into mine and gave me a 
	bitter smile. If I didn't know any better, I would think she was mad at me 
	for some unknown reason. I didn't let it bother me. I heard she has been a 
	bit fried from so many uploads. I think I even over heard that she might 
	have turned Schizo.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">When I reached the front counter Jerry 
	wasn't there. Thomas was in attendance. Thomas came to Braintec the same 
	time I did. He was a very well built and a very attractive African-American 
	fellow. Thomas was also quite the ladies man. If his contagious smile didn't 
	make you blush, he would know just what to say to do it. <i>&quot;Hey Beautiful!&quot;</i> 
	He said to me when I approached him at the counter. I smiled and said, <i>
	&quot;So Thomas, can you tell me when Jerry will be working the counter?&quot; </i>
	Thomas replied while gesturing to his well sculpted chest, <i>&quot;Jerry? Come 
	on girl. You gonna tell me Jerry has something I don't?&quot;</i> I said, <i>
	&quot;Well,...as a matter of fact, he does have something you don't!&quot; </i>Thomas 
	looked at the ceiling as though it was going to give him an answer. <i>
	&quot;Thomas,&quot; </i>I said. <i>&quot;Jerry has information that I need. Don't worry 
	your still physically superior to all the front desk boys!&quot; </i>I smiled and 
	winked at him. I think I actually made him blush with my comment. <i>&quot;You 
	know you love me!&quot; </i>He replied. <i>&quot;But seriously, what kind of 
	information do you need? &quot;Well,&quot;</i> I said. <i>&quot;A very good friend of mine 
	is in trouble and I was hoping he might have some information as to where 
	she might be. He seems to know everything that happens around here, 
	including the behind the scenes kind of things.&quot; &quot;Oh, you mean your girl 
	Carmen?&quot;</i> Thomas said. I was momentarily speechless. <i>&quot;Yes, Carmen! Do 
	you know where she's at?&quot; </i></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial"><i>&quot;Yea,&quot; </i>Thomas said. <i>&quot;I was working 
	the counter last night, cause this is my day for a double shift. But anyway, 
	these two older guys came in here and said they found your car smashed into 
	a tree down the road. They said you and Carmen were unconscience in the car. 
	They figured that you guys were coming from here so they brought you back. 
	Dr. Hamilton had two of the security nurses bring you and Carmen in on 
	stretchers. You mean you don't remember that?&quot; &quot;Carmen is here?&quot;</i> I said.
	<i>&quot;Where?&quot; &quot;I don't know, but I watched you both get wheeled in last 
	night.&quot; </i>Thomas said. <i>&quot;You girls gotta be more careful driving at 
	night. I haven't had the chance to take ya'll out yet!&quot; &quot;One more question.&quot;</i> 
	I said to Thomas. <i>&quot;Where there any younger guys with them? You know, like 
	my age?&quot; &quot;Baby, if your lookin for a man...&quot;</i> he said insinuating he was 
	offering his services. I gave him a look showing that I was serious and he 
	said, <i>&quot;No, just the two older guys.&quot; &quot;Thank you so much, Thomas!&quot;</i> I 
	said, and I leaned over and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-family:Arial">As I walked away I felt a little better 
	knowing Carmen was here somewhere. I was, however, worried of her condition. 
	I planned that I would have to use Adrian to help me find her. I know deep 
	down it's wrong, but Carmen would do it for me!</span></p>
