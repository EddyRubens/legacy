    There I am, in Tokyo. After arrival I was roaming about the airport all 
    morning. I was exhausted. I hardly slept on the plane. I have been watching 
    two lousy movies and a documentary about Inca’s. I couldn’t relax at all. 
    I’m rather restless. It feels like I’m on the run. They are most probably 
    looking for me now. At the same time I wish to be found, by the people who 
    work for Kodjiro. How on earth am I going to find them?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Due to the time 
    difference I had the feeling I arrived in Japan in the afternoon, while the 
    sun was rising again here. I had not the slightest idea where I had to go 
    and tried to sleep for a while. How inconvenient those hours. End of the 
    morning I exchanged my last dollars for yen. Not much, I’m afraid. I spent 
    half of it on a meal of noodles, which they call ‘ramen’ over here, and a 
    train ticket to the centre of Tokyo. A hard job. They don’t speak English as 
    much as I thought they would. So many Japanese words were going through my 
    head before I understood I had to buy a ticket first from the slot machine, 
    before they could serve ‘ramen’. It would be much easier if they showed 
    photos of the meals attached to the slot machine instead of those strange 
    letter indications. I had no idea which meal I had ordered. I chose the 
    cheapest one. The food was a bit dull but eatable. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Buying my train ticket 
    was a great adventure as well. Also this dispenser was confusing. The only 
    thing I understood was the huge red button mentioning ‘help’. I pressed this 
    button a few times. Suddenly a piece of metal beside the dispenser 
    disappeared and a man’s head with glasses was showing. <i>“Can I help you?”</i> 
    the head asked. His English was bad but I managed to explain which train I 
    had to take. My ticket was also valid in the metro. As long as I didn’t pass 
    the small gates outside, I could travel throughout the whole city. So I did. 
    The metro is traveling above the ground quit often so I was able to see a 
    lot of the town. Tokyo seems to have more than twenty centers. After every 
    trip by metro you reach another central spot full of flashing neon-lights. 
    Almost everybody sleeps in the metro. Whether they sit down or stand up. On 
    every briefcase and mobile phone small dolls are attached. Also businessmen 
    wearing black suits and shining shoes are decorated with Pikachu or Hamtaro.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Being in the metro for a few hours I got out at Kokkaigijidomae. I liked 
    that name. I put my luggage into a locker. For the price of 850 yen! 
    Spending so much money again in one day I will not have much left. Don’t 
    think of it now. Do they have Salvation Army here? I hope I will find 
    Kodjiro, Sonja or Jessica as soon as possible. I’m afraid I’m looking for a 
    needle in a haystack. </span></p>
