    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I arrived at Dr. 
    Hamilton's office he was eating inside. I apologized for interrupting and 
    started to walk out. He stopped me and asked me to please come in. His deli 
    sandwich smelled wonderful! I didn't realized that I hadn't eaten until I 
    smelled the freshly cut turkey slices on his sandwich. I sat down opposite 
    from him and did my best not to stare at his lunch. He pulled out another 
    sandwich wrapped in white paper from a bag on his desk. He placed it in 
    front of me with a bag of Ruffles and a Diet Coke. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He said, <i>&quot;I hope 
    you like turkey!&quot;</i>&nbsp; I smiled and proceeded to unwrap the sandwich. I was 
    exactly how I would have ordered it, Swiss cheese, no mustard, no onions, 
    add some avocado! It was fabulous! I asked him how he knew my favorite deli 
    sandwich. He just smiled and said, <i>&quot;Remember Honey, I specialize in 
    working with the brain! I know more about you than you probably do!&quot;&nbsp;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He apologized for 
    starting to eat without me. He said he was starving. I said that was fine, I 
    wasn't aware it was a lunch meeting. He just smiled and said, <i>&quot;Meeting?&quot;</i> 
    I told him that there was a note on the door of my room that said he wanted 
    to talk to me about something. <i>&quot;Oh, right! right!&quot;</i> He said. <i>&quot;Let's 
    just have lunch first. I don't like to eat and do business at the same 
    time.&quot;</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">He was acting kinda 
    strange. Not like I had ever seen him before. I don't want to sound 
    conceited or forward in anyway but, I get the feeling Dr. Hamilton has a bit 
    of a crush on me. I have never heard him call anyone else 'Honey' before. 
    And how often does he find out other test subject favorite sandwiches and 
    treat them to lunch? It all seemed too uncomfortable to me. Maybe since his 
    colleague Dr. Tachikawa is involved with Rosanne (it's so obvious) Dr. 
    Hamilton wants a young fling of his own. Well, if he really knows more about 
    me that I do, he'll know that I have Josh!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I figured I would just 
    eat, find out what he wanted to talk about and get out. I was starving and 
    figured what would be the point of passing up a free lunch! I also was 
    curious as to why Dr. Hamilton wanted to see me. Maybe I was going to get 
    another upload. That would be so great. I would like to experience the cabin 
    and the wild flowers. I wondered if I should ask for that? After lunch I 
    figured, I would ask after lunch.</span></p>
