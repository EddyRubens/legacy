    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was finally alone 
    with Rosanne. The first two days she was very busy putting the finishing 
    touch to the presentations and sending the invitations to the new test 
    subjects. She had done her best in Holland. After I made clear to hear that 
    I had something very important to discuss, we finally made an appointment. I 
    definitely had to tell her what Adelle and I had witnessed. On her 
    insistence we went to Elisa’s Bar. Didn’t seem to be a good idea to go to 
    there but I couldn’t resist because I asked her several times already to 
    visit Elisa’s Bar. It is such a nice place. Not really a bar, more like a 
    living room. And all sort of people who don’t fit in the regular circuit.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I 
    found it very difficult. I didn’t know were to start. <i>“Well, twit!”</i>, 
    I thought, come on with it. I took a deep breath and started to tell. That 
    Adelle and I had seen them sitting at the same table as we did right now. 
    Rosanne wanted to know, who we saw and I smashed out the whole story. 
    Rosanne seems to explode when I told her it was Jessica and Tachikawa. She 
    called me a liar while she knew I wasn’t making this up. I told her about 
    the champagne, the tickets and the cuddling. That became clearly too much 
    for her. First she had been wiggling on her chair, but now she stood up and 
    took the first thing surrounding her, it was a chair. She held it high above 
    her head and smashed it on the floor. That wasn’t enough so she smashed 
    another one. It clashed rockhard against the wall. A huge painting felt 
    down. It’s good that it wasn’t so crowded, therefore nobody got hurt. 
    Happily everyone could escape the firing line on time. I had never seen this 
    woman behaving this way. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I had to calm her 
    down. Suddenly she stood still and shrinks. I touched her and pushed her 
    against me. Her head on my shoulder. She started to cry. The release of all 
    the emotions streamed away in a flood of tears. Jesus, why me. Look at the 
    disaster. Rosanne in a total wreck, the fragmentations and broken furniture 
    lying around. I could only think of one thing. Getting out of here. I walked 
    towards Elisa and gave her one hundred dollar. That should be enough. Maybe 
    that could save my reputation. Then quickly out of here, outside and walking. 
    We had to go for a walk, which is the best remedy against everything that 
    you have to let go. Let your feet do the job. We walked to the end of the 
    street and ended downwards at the harbour. We didn’t say a word. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We could sit down at 
    some pallets at the waterside. Rosanne started to ask what I thought about 
    Tachikawa. Is it serious for him or was it just a nice evening. I told her 
    about the tickets and about Tachikawa’s work lately. The new M-Stores he is 
    creating. I think he’s up to more than just medical science. This technique 
    would be perfect for the use of a Virtual Reality environment. If it’s 
    possible to combine this technique with computer games, he’ll have the big, 
    and I mean the VERY BIG, money in containers waiting for him. Just imagine: 
    no need for huge VR-glasses on your nose, just gaming without problems. When 
    Rosanne understood what I was saying she suddenly had a glitch in her eyes 
    and she said through her tears: <i>“He is really smart, Tachikawa, isn’t he?”</i> 
    She suddenly started to see the good side of this fellow while she wanted to 
    rip his hart out only thirty minutes ago. <i>“But what does he wants from 
    Jessica?”</i> I asked her. Rosanne couldn’t find an answer either. </span>
