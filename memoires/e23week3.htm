    Maybe it all sounds too negative. Problems, uncertainties and psychotic 
    disorders. Braintec’s future is at stake. I’m getting schizophrenia and the 
    test subjects are deciding to quit. I think it’s awful that Dr. Tachikawa 
    has left. Apart from that, the rest is okay.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian is extremely 
    happy because his developments made progressions. Maybe, one of these days, 
    he is able to transform our dreams into vision. I’m rather anxious to know.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Compared to previous 
    days Dr. Hamilton is in a very good mood. He had lunch with Frank. It is 
    most likely that Frank is willing to help and surely can help us indeed. 
    Shortly he will talk to his colleague who would be the right person for the 
    job dealing with investments. It is obvious that it pleases Dr. Hamilton. 
    His influence on the test subjects has made good results. Nobody is talking 
    about going home anymore. The behavior of the test subjects resembles the 
    stock market.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I talked to Sally this 
    afternoon. She was hesitating most, between all of us. Thanks to the 
    memories she knows exactly what she wants and she is grateful to Braintec 
    for that. She will no longer work in the boutique. Her idea is to finish her 
    studies after Braintec. That seems to be a good decision. When she had 
    decided on that she couldn’t wait starting her action. I usually feel the 
    same thing. I would be rather impatient if I were to be in her position. 
    Besides that, I did manage to make her stay for some time.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">And Pedro, a new test 
    subject from Spain, also gives us a good time. Up till now he hasn’t much to 
    worry about yet because he just recovered from the operation. Pedro is a 
    happy person. His laughter is very catching. He cannot wait any longer to 
    receive his first upload. I can imagine. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">But 
    where Sonja might be... It is already more than a whole week since I saw 
    her. Nobody knows where she is. Probably she had more than enough of all the 
    rubbish. Besides that, she also had her problems with Hugo. I regret that 
    she didn’t say a farewell. We had a lot in common, I thought.</span></p>
