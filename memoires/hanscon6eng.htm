    <span style="font-family: Arial">We walk relaxed as patient and guide beside 
    the road. After a couple of minutes we hear noises behind us. They seem to 
    have discovered our escape. The Brainteccers were effing and blinding 
    because their car can’t pass the gate closed by the electric failure. Time 
    to get off road. Hikers are too conspicuous. There is a path between two 
    companies that ends at a little bush. Arriving there we hear children’s 
    voices. We walk to there and reach a schoolyard. This seems to be the best 
    place to get away, because there isn’t normal public transport. We say that 
    we have a breakdown and ask if we can go with the school bus to find a 
    garage. There isn’t a school bus, but in a while parents and nannies will 
    arrive to get up the children. We ask a nanny if we may join her. The 
    Philippine girl doesn’t speak much English but she takes us with her. I have 
    unbound myself. The ever registering laptop is still at my back. That isn’t 
    easy at the car seat. After thirty minutes driving we are dropped at a 
    garage in a rich villa neighborhood in Portland. Heather wants to rent a car. 
    The man from the car rental has the local radio on. The news about two 
    escaped criminals. The description resembles us perfectly. We aren’t safe 
    yet. In the distance I see a red-white van heading this way. Getting out of 
    here. At a company building behind the garage a driver is having troubles 
    getting his cargo into his wagon. We help him and ask for possibilities to 
    get away from there. He confirms that renting a car is the only possibility, 
    but we can drive with him to a truckers bar in another suburb of Portland.

    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">That turns out to be 
    far away. It is a two hour drive and at the border of cultivation. At that 
    place are busses and taxi’s driving through. The TV is on at the bar. Two 
    pictures are shown that are very familiar to us. They are taken from the 
    Braintec website! So we head the other way. Through the backdoor into 
    nature. No map, no compass but the sun is shining and we can find directions 
    by sunlight. Away from the buildings and we will see where we strand. We 
    could get us some fat American snacks in the road house to get rid of our 
    hunger at night. Slept outside underneath our luggage. Slept close to 
    Heather to fight the chill. I can imagine worse. This morning quit fit again. 
    Heather is removing the laptop from my body. It is too unhandy to walk with 
    it. It is attached to my body with wires. We improvise band-aid to stop the 
    bleeding. It is all painful but it works. Another Big-ofeverything to eat 
    and on our way. We are going up a hill. At the top we rest to overview the 
    area. I can write this on the laptop.</span></p>
