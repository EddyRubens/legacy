    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I got back to my 
    room, I found Carmen still asleep. Seeing her still there, asleep, was like 
    a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I woke her up and told her she 
    should get ready to go. She looked at the clock and jumped up when she 
    noticed the time was 5:10pm. <i>&quot;We're going to be late to dinner with the 
    agents!&quot; </i>She said.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I decided to wait to 
    tell her about Kaleb and Megan. She already had a rough day and I didn't 
    want to stress her out any more than she already was. I waited until she 
    went into the bathroom then I pulled out the business card that Agent 
    Andrews had given me. I turned it over and read the phone number he had 
    written on the back.&nbsp; I wondered if I should call to inform him about Kaleb 
    and Megan missing. I thought about it for a few minutes. Just when I decided 
    that I would call, Carmen came out of the bathroom and said, <i>&quot;You ready 
    to go? I'm starved!&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We left the room and 
    went down the hall to the front desk. Adrian was standing there when we 
    signed out to leave for dinner. He commented on how he was hungry as well, 
    and he should find some place to have dinner. <i>&quot;...Some place quiet and 
    romantic with a cute girl.&quot; </i>Is what he said. I smiled and told him he 
    shouldn't have a hard time finding a cute girl to have dinner with. Carmen 
    elbowed me in the ribs. It was her cue for me to shut up and get going. I 
    told him to enjoy his dinner and that we'd see him later. He just smiled as 
    we walked out.</span></p>
