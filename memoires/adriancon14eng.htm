    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was lovely last 
    weekend. My trip to the Crater Lake seems gorgeously quiet. I was all alone 
    in my little camper. While I putted a CD in the drive, I had to think about 
    that good old 8-track players. How they used to look like in America. Huge 
    bulky things. But with a very good sound with Dolby<sup>®</sup>. I’m 
    completely into Steve Earle lately. A tremendously country singer I can 
    completely identify with. Finally REST. No Uploads for the time being, no 
    intrigues, Braintec is far away. Back to myself. In nature, as my father 
    taught me. Appreciate everything The Creator made. At the end of the day I 
    reached the lake coast. It looked tremendously. So huge. I couldn’t see the 
    end of the lake from where I stood at the parking. But I missed the colours 
    as they were shown inside the flyers. They must be gone by the low sun’s 
    altitude. At the pictures it’s all azure blue. Now it was just GG (Grubby 
    and Grey). </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The next day I saw The 
    Lake in its full glory. What a colour! This was so beautiful. Such a colour 
    you can’t imagine! </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In the morning I 
    bought some provisions for the rest of the day. Donuts Bagels, apple-pie, 
    fruit and drinks. I putted everything in my backpack and went to walk. After 
    several hours I became tired of walking and lied down for a while at the 
    edge of an open spot inside the pine forest. Then I got the dream (or was it 
    another upload, I don’t know yet) All in black and white. The most bizarre 
    images went by. All so phantom. Scary, too vague, this isn’t where I want to 
    be! That is what I thought when I woke up. I am the most concerned about the 
    girl that runs away with her fingers in her ears. Away From Here! That’s 
    what it looked like. It’s almost as if I get new uploads, here inside the 
    forest. Is the whole world infected? I want some rest at the edge of this 
    lake. </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">This wasn’t funny. I 
    got tanked up with memories far beyond the imagination. Especially now, far 
    away form all the intrigues I get this stuff that I can’t comprehend, that I 
    don’t know how to handle. I want to go home. Which home, Elgin? Research 
    centre? The mobile home? I don’t know it anymore. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">My cell phone was 
    bleeping to wake me from this dream. Thanks to God or anybody else who did 
    this. It was Pete, my best friend from Scotland. Before he could ask for the 
    reason of calling me I told him what I had experienced and where I was right 
    now. That he helped me to get out of this dream, to come back to myself. 
    &nbsp;“That’s what friends are for isn’t it?” I must say he was right. He gave me 
    the good advice to talk to a psychologist as soon as possible. As if that’s 
    going to help me. OK Pete, you’re right. Monday I’ll go to Jessica or &nbsp;ehhh 
    no, better to Sheila. Seems wiser. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">At one of my walks by 
    the lake something funny happened as well. It was so quiet. No human being 
    to see. After two days talking to myself I saw a backpacker walking in the 
    distance. He walked into my direction. Hé nice, I thought. A little chat. 
    But what happened: we approached each other and I just wanted to say hello 
    and walk towards him. It was too bizarre. He walked further and only said: “hi”. 
    I looked amazed at him. A Canadian flag at his backpack. He didn’t turn 
    around at all. Just walked further. &nbsp;“hé!” I shouted, but he didn’t respond. 
    “Am I really here” I started to wonder. It truly seemed to be a very long 
    dream. Only at Sunday morning I came a bit to myself. Finally real rest. I 
    had a good breakfast in a little restaurant at the lake side and I drove 
    back to the research centre without hurry. What must I think about these 
    dreams (or where they uploads) I don’t know yet. But I want to find out. Are 
    there more things uploaded than just the direct images. Is my mind getting 
    clogged up, polluted with all sort of things? Or were they just dreams? Jeee, 
    I can’t shake it off.</span></p>
