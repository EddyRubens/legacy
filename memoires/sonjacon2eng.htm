    <span style="font-family: Arial">I couldn’t write anything down. Even 
    sitting behind the cheap white chip board desk in my room, where for weeks 
    (have I been here that long?) paper and pen have waited, is a major effort. 
    And when I’m sitting, I wrack my brain trying to find something significant, 
    but I feel empty and everything looks ugly. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Rosanne, who is a fussy 
    and rather zealous type who talks with her hands a lot (and likes a drink!), 
    does her best to put me at ease. I can see she’s trying, and I like her, but 
    it doesn’t register. I didn’t even want to know the results of the EEG, and 
    the hypnotic sessions were a fiasco. The doctor thought I wasn’t open to 
    suggestion enough although I’m really trying to cooperate. I probably won’t 
    go to ‘The Leftwing’. I hear the others whispering about it as if it’s 
    somewhere sacred, some type of paradise, the solution to all their problems 
    or something like that. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">I haven’t spoken to Hugo for two weeks now. 
    Not since after he told me, crying on the phone and everything, that he is 
    in love with his assistant. Sylvia works at his practice. She’s young, a 
    natural beauty, full of life and energetic, into aerobics and she’s insanely 
    bourgeois. I couldn’t say a word, didn’t even know what to say, so I slammed 
    the phone down and sat staring at it the following hour. I arrived at the 
    evaluation too late and told them I had fallen asleep. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">The first few days I acted as if nothing 
    was wrong and cooperated with the research just like the others. I even 
    acted cheerful at a party. I did drink way too much, so when I got back I 
    struggled my way through gallons of tears and snot. Full of self reproach 
    and self pity of course. The next day I looked awful and Doctor Hamilton 
    asked me if I needed to talk. I got out of it by telling him I‘m allergic to 
    crustaceans and that there must have been a few in the fish soup. I assured 
    him I was taking pills for it. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I’m 
    writing this while sitting in the Japanese garden, which has become my 
    favorite sanctuary on the Braintec grounds. I feel very lonely, and though 
    I’m angry at Hugo (why did he ever want to marry me?), I do miss him 
    terribly. We went through a lot together in a short period, especially stuff 
    to do with his career. But why doesn’t he call me? Will I return to an empty 
    house, has he already moved into that dancing girl’s place? Maybe he will 
    have committed suicide, plagued with guilt and remorse… Not good, I’m 
    becoming way too sentimental over this. I think I’ll call him tomorrow. I 
    can see Alice the Malice coming this way so it’s time to stop writing.</span></p>
