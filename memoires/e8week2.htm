    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The extraction turned 
    out to be better than I expected. I was afraid just for nothing. But it was 
    very tiring. After they connected all the wires to the extractor, I had to 
    do some relaxation exercises. That was difficult for me because I really had 
    the collywobbles. They had to give me some pill for that. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I was asked to fully 
    concentrate on a huge clock that they’d placed in front of me. The kind of 
    clock you will see at a train station. Dr. Steward asked me with a 
    hypnotizing voice to concentrate at all the details. The mechanical ticking 
    distracted me from the shape and the details and this clock was also giving 
    me too much associations. The end of time, New Year’s Eve, waiting for my 
    boyfriend to pick me up to the prom. Dr. Hamilton wasn’t satisfied by that. 
    He talked something through with Dr. Tachikawa who was indeed happy with the 
    diagrams he was reading from the screen<i>. “Keep them basic, keep them 
    basic”</i> Dr. Hamilton repeated. </span>
    <span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">It took at least three and a half 
    hour. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-weight:700">The first hour passed by very 
    slowly; I have literally followed the pointers. After then I entered some 
    kind of flush in which time didn’t matter. At that moment the clock became 
    an object without a meaning and without associations. I cannot tell at which 
    moment the extraction took place. Mark, the test subject who’d got my memory 
    uploaded the same afternoon, said that the clock pointed five to two. That 
    will be it then. I am so tired of today that I want to go to sleep early. 
    And I have an headache. I guess that will be over after a good night sleep.
