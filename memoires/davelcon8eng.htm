    over, I was flush with the joy of being alive.&nbsp; I was looking at all 
    situations from four different angles.&nbsp; Instead of seeing the doctor, I saw, 
    the doctor's mother, how she must have encouraged him to read by rubbing his 
    back when he was a child.&nbsp; Everone was &quot;someone reinforced or prohibited,&quot; 
    and not just a mass of being, sitting in their modern world, trapped from 
    meaning.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Was the existentialist 
    in me dying?&nbsp; I wanted to make love to the cold earth.&nbsp; I wanted to 
    transmute with it, into an everchanging Walt Whitman of a creature.&nbsp; I 
    wanted to find myself under my own feet.&nbsp; I was more than one.&nbsp; I was a 
    multiplicated human being.&nbsp; I was plural, yet not at all alone and crazy.&nbsp; I 
    joined hands with myself, just by looking across the quad at four females 
    playing soccer in their shorts and sweatshirts.&nbsp; I was giving shrift to the 
    almighty, simply by breathing.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It is hard to explain 
    all of this at once.&nbsp; But that's the only way to explain it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">AT ONCE.&nbsp; We are many 
    AT ONCE.&nbsp; WE ARE AT ONCE.&nbsp; Future and finite, immediate and infinite.&nbsp; And 
    our death is our beginning and our beginning is our death.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">And it already 
    happened and is happening.&nbsp; </span></p>

    tomorrow will be gone before we know it.&nbsp; </span></p>

    right out of this earth.</span></p>
