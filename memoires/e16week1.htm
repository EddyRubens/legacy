    Adelle is almost completely recovered from the operation. Amazing how little 
    time the test subjects need for the operation nowadays. Lately technique has 
    improved enormously, it is rather obvious. And I, however, thought it a 
    privilege to get a MESI as a third person and as the first woman. If I 
    recall all misery which I’ve gone through after my operation I almost feel 
    ashamed. Compared to the fast recovery of the new test subjects I feel like 
    a softy. Having a MESI is nothing special in particular anymore. In “my 
    time” only 14% of the people were suitable for a MESI, now it is definitely 
    80%. More often I overheard that it is the choice of the test subject 
    himself. <i>“Do you prefer the small or rather the large implant?” </i>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Therefore also Adelle 
    has a MESI now and she interferes with everything again. When I expressed my 
    astonishment about her fast recovery she told me that she experienced a 
    couple of years of training. First I didn’t understand what she meant. <i>
    “Or did you believe this smooth peach-skin is natural at my age?”</i> Yes, 
    of course. At a distance of twenty meters you can discover that Adelle has 
    been visiting a plastic surgeon for more than once. When Adelle mentioned 
    the list of operations I presume that they have become friends by now. 
    Adelle showed me photos of the operations. She talked about it as if she 
    visited the local beauty saloons. She had her nose done at least three times. 
    The first time it was okay but still not quite perfect. It can be better, 
    she thought. When the plastic surgeon did his utmost he resulted in making 
    it even worse. The third operation was meant to recover the damage a bit. 
    She still is not satisfied with it at all. From aside the nose is rather 
    bumpy and from the front even a bit crooked. I don’t see it that way. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She also had an 
    operation on her chin, on her eyes, her neck and of course her breasts. But 
    that is really a long time ago. Proudly she showed me her tummy. <i>“It’s 
    all mine!”</i> she said and drummed on it for a while<i>. “Just slightly a 
    bit of fitness but never ever gone through surgery.”</i> For a woman of her 
    age she must be satisfied indeed. She put her T-shirt back into her jeans 
    and heaved a deep sigh. <i>“But of all adjustments to my body this is still 
    the most touching one...”</i> she whispered and she rubbed along the left 
    side of her head. <i>“That I can attend what others have experienced and 
    that I can share with them what was important to me! That is really 
    fantastic.”</i> Happiness was showing on Adelle and I am happy for her. Now 
    it is my turn.&nbsp; </span></p>
