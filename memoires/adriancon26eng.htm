    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Good memories were 
    promised. Well this was a good one indeed. It was at the end of August. I 
    was in France at a small campsite next to a small airport prominently used 
    for gliders and parachutists. After a lovely meal in the evening sun we 
    moved towards the airport to see falling stars. It was getting colder now, 
    but the hot sun in middle France had warmed up the small black airstrip 
    completely. I walked hand in hand with my girlfriend. When we felt how much 
    heath the airstrip was radiating we laid down on our backs. Everyone, next 
    to each other, hand in hand. My girlfriend and I were lying side by side. 
    Quit soon we saw the first meteorites. I didn’t believe in making a wish, 
    but it was such a beautiful view. The little eliminated pieces of space 
    waste skimmed along from ever changing directions. Stripes several meters 
    long painted the black sky. We were hardly speaking, we were too impressed. 
    Suddenly I stopped breathing. At the sky a bleu-green glowing meteorite was 
    making a red, white and orange stripe through the zenith. It was so huge! 
    For a second I thought it would come too close and that we were gone. But 
    the bowl of fire burst. Making much more small sparks and slowly smothered. 
    Dumb of surprise and respect nobody moved. Then the hit came. Seconds later 
    we heard the sound the rock made when it exploded at huge distance. 
    Overwhelming! I made a wish, while I felt at her hand that she was wishing 
    as well. This was magic. The complete connection between people, almost 
    without physical contact, almost without communication. It was between us. 
    Just above us. There something indescribable drifted by. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was done. The 
    upload was over. I came back in reality with tears in my eyes. How happy a 
    person can be. It was so intense. As soon as I thought back and the images 
    were on my retina again I burst into tears again. That stayed this way for 
    half an hour. Sheila had, when she saw what was happening to me opened the 
    door and went out with Steward. That was nice. Now I could relish the memory 
    without being disturbed. </span></p>
