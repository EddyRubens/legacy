    <span style="font-family: Arial">Problems. It seemed to go so fine in the 
    beginning. Everything was perfectly organized. They even added a train 
    ticket Ajrnhem-Schiphol to the documents. The journey started Sunday evening 
    but it wasn’t spectacular. The plane was half empty. A lot of people seemed 
    to prefer not the fly during the war in Iraq. I assume it is even safer now 
    with the extra security. I have asked if there are more passengers for 
    Braintec but there aren’t. The convenience of an almost empty airplane is 
    the opportunity to sleep stretched out using four seats.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Changing at Chicago. 
    Couldn’t see much of the airport because it was dark. The second plane wasn’t 
    full either. So I could sleep a bit more and arrived at Portland in good 
    shape. A man with a red-white Braintec-sign waited for me at the exit. We 
    left inside a red-white van. Strange, even now no other passengers. I asked 
    the man several things concerning Braintec but I didn’t get much answers. He 
    was only the driver, he said. I couldn’t see much from Portland. We drove 
    through long stretched industrial parks and some suburbs with a lot of 
    bungalows and every now and then a huge supermarket. Suddenly the 
    Braintec-building showed up in such a business park. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The welcoming was 
    neat. The whole building was decorated in red-white. Even the drinks! Milk 
    and tomato juice at lunch, red and white wine at night. There wasn’t a 
    division of the chambers, I’ve got a four persons room for me alone, kind of 
    a three-star-hotel. Organizational structures were discussed. Everything is 
    organized in this building. During off-days I can get money out of an ATM 
    which will be compensated with my expenses. The guided tour wasn’t much. It 
    is a hotel with operation chamber, surrounded by a garden. I haven’t seen 
    other test subjects yet, neither during my walk in the garden after the 
    tour. The garden has some nice red and white flowers. High fences separate 
    the terrain from the rest of the business park. The porter avoided my 
    question about the reason for these security manners. During diner I met the 
    first other test subjects. No Dutch people, three American women and a 
    Japanese couple. Non of them had surgery yet. So they can’t tell me their 
    experiences. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">&nbsp;</span></p>
