    Again another upload. I was desperately longing for another upload but I was 
    too upset heading towards laboratory. Imagine what could happen if I saw Dr. 
    Tachikawa and Jessica? Already one of them made it impossible for me to keep 
    paying attention to the upload. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Luckily both of them 
    were not there. No need to explain Dr. Tachikawa’s absence. Normally he 
    works on those M-Stores ready for use during day and night. However, I could 
    not find a good excuse for Jessica’s absence. <i>“Jessica not here today?”</i> I asked with an open mind. Reactions of the members of the board were striking. 
    Steward could not hear a thing and fully neglected my question. Sheila also 
    looked into the other direction as often as possible. Something is going on! 
    Finally Dr. Hamilton answered my question<i>. “Jessica made advantage of all 
    her days off,”</i> he said while he looked at me trying to understand me. <i>
    “She was longing for a break just like you.” “Just like me?”</i> In my tired 
    head suddenly a brightness showed up which misapprehended the whole matter.
    <i>“It was Jessica who wanted me to leave from here!”</i> I suddenly shouted 
    and now in return my colleagues had problems looking into the other 
    direction. <i>“You bitch!”</i> Again I was in need of throwing things at 
    everybody. Fortunately I could control myself. <i>“And Dr. Tachikawa? Is Dr. 
    Tachikawa really that busy so that I haven’t seen a glimpse of him yet, or 
    you are just telling me that on purpose? I’m sure he is in bed with Jessica 
    at this moment!”</i> Dr. Hamilton made clear I should sit down for a while 
    and reached to me a glass of water. I calmed down again. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">A 
    few minutes later I received the upload. It was a strange one. One moment I 
    was on a sort of sightseeing boat and in the next women in feathers were 
    suddenly dancing in front of my eyes. <i>“I’m getting mad!”</i> was the 
    first thing I said when the upload was over. <i>“Or is something wrong with 
    this memory?”</i> Dr. Hamilton acknowledged that the last conclusion would 
    probably be the case. Also Steve and Adrian had seen strange figures. They 
    told everybody in details and that’s why Dr. Hamilton was happy he could 
    test the memory on me. I was the only one who did not know beforehand what 
    kinds of figures were mixed through it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Sheila wanted to 
    discuss the matter a bit longer after the usual interview. I suggested we 
    should do so next time for my headache was giving me such a hard time that 
    every thought was painful. She gave me some tranquillizers and told me I was 
    welcome any time if I felt like talking about it. No way, no more test 
    psychologists for me anymore. I jumped into bed and I planned for myself to 
    stay there for good.</span></p>
