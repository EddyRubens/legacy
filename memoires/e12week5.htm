    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I woke up this 
    morning I immediately noticed that the amusement park memory was gone. I 
    remembered of course but I didn’t feel the sensation anymore. Pity. It was a 
    fantastic feeling that I’d love to experience everyday. I got lucky really, 
    when I think about it. I was talking with so much enthusiasm about the sound 
    of that roller coaster yesterday that the entire team agreed that we should 
    try to record it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Initially I didn’t fully understand what they were on about and technically 
    I still don’t follow but what it comes down to is that Adrian can extract a 
    memory in the form of a sound. He’s been working day and night with his 
    equipment and is now able to turn data into sound. It’s a marvelous thing. 
    Something from a science fiction story. But it really works. Adrian ran a 
    file of the dogsledge-trip I had experienced before. I was completely 
    shocked. <i>“How did he…, how can he…?”</i> His detailed explanation went in 
    one ear and out the other. And I was still perplexed. First I thought they 
    might be leading me on. But they all remained deadly serious and Adrian got 
    a compliment. <i>“What we want to do today,”</i> Dr. Tachikawa started 
    explaining, <i>“is upload the amusement park memory once more. You will 
    focus again on the cart and we will extract the necessary data for Adrian’s 
    project. Is that alright?”</i> Yeah, sure that’s alright. I wanted nothing 
    more than to be at that amusement park again. This time the re-experience 
    seemed like a repeat of yesterday’s. More concentrating on the roller 
    coaster wasn’t possible. It seemed like I had reached the limit of this 
    memory. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian needed a lot of 
    time to process the recorded data. So at the end of the afternoon Dr. 
    Tachikawa came to get me and together we walked to Adrian’s computer room. 
    Our hands touched a couple of times while we walked through the halls. I 
    didn’t dare grab his hand though. Dr. Tachikawa was happy, I could feel that. 
    We took large steps as if in a hurry. I wouldn’t have minded if we’d walked 
    at a slower pace or if Adrian’s workspace had been further away because I 
    hugely enjoyed being with Dr. Tachikawa. He gently guided me into the room. 
    More smiling faces. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"><i>“Alright, here it 
    comes!”</i> Adrian said, and he started the file. Again, I was perplexed. As 
    the sound of the thundering roller coaster filled the room all the details 
    came back to me. This I hadn’t expected. I must have turned pale all of a 
    sudden, because I was offered a chair to sit on. Unbelievable.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial"> </span> <embed src="images/rollercoaster.wav" hidden="true" width="20" height="15"></p>
