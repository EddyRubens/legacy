    <span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">The hotel that we had chosen at 
    the Tourist Information isn’t looking good. It is empty, boring. Wouldn’t 
    there be something else to find? Close to it there is a nice looking 
    exposition space. We go in. Good art of young Japanese artists. We chat with 
    the owner, who can fortunately make himself clear in English. We ask him if 
    he knows a better hotel. Oh yes he does. In the neighborhood is a guesthouse 
    where a lot of artists stay when they want to spent some time in the center 
    of Tokyo. That isn’t so rich but it is cozy and a part of the artists speak 
    English. Heather and I both buy a small art object in his gallery. The 
    credit cards work well.</span><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">On our way to the guesthouse. Heather thinks we are being followed. I have 
    that feeling as well, since we left that recommended hotel. We follow a 
    slalom route for a while and separate shortly and then look back. It is 
    clear now that someone is following us. That can’t be FBI or Japanese police 
    because they can follow us through our credit cards if they want to. It has 
    to be Braintec! How do they know where we are? The following started at the 
    hotel. Were they waiting for us there? Heather says that the Japanese from 
    the Tourist Information at the airport recommended this hotel very 
    explicitly. Should she be part of Braintec?</span><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">We decide to get rid of this follower before we reach the guesthouse. 
    Through a department store we manage. The guesthouse is far behind at the 
    highest floor above a gallery. There is space enough, so we can get in 
    despite the fact we’re not artists. It exists of a couple of ateliers, a 
    couple of sleeping rooms and a shared living room and kitchen. The artists 
    ask immediately if we can make contact in the United States and in the 
    Netherlands. They like to expose abroad. We promise to do our best when we 
    get home. </span>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family: Arial" lang="nl">How long shall it take before 
    Braintec finds us again? If we go for the most known tourist attractions 
    they will certainly find us. We think it is a nice sport to trace the 
    followers and to get rid of them again. We won’t let them involve in our 
    program and are going to enjoy Japan. What do we surely want to see? I name 
    the temple of the Golden Pavilion and Mount Fuji. That turns out to be 
    Heather’s favorites as well. Today we only view the gallery beneath the 
    guesthouse. One of the artists wants to cook for us. We say that we will pay 
    for the groceries. Together with him we go shopping. That’s how we get to 
    see how a Japanese supermarket looks like. It looks tasty, but no sake for 
    me. Fortunately there is also normal beer in Japan. The meal tastes 
    excellent. The conversation was interesting but slow. From the five Japanese 
    people at the table one spoke English well and one a bit. That was 
    constantly translating. With their information we can fill a couple of weeks 
    vacation around Tokyo.<br>
    <br>
    Later that night another Japanese comes in. He has a moonlight as a cleaner. 
    They don’t know about a WIK (Dutch payment for artists) in Japan. The hotel 
    we are going to is one of the buildings he cleans. He has heard that lately 
    some belongings were brought to one of the hotel rooms. The hotel owner had 
    said him to prepare that room separately. Heather and I suggest that’s a 
    Braintec action for us. <br>
