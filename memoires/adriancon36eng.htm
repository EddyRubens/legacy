    <span style="font-family: Arial">It was late in the afternoon when Rosanne 
    woke me up. <i>“We must find a room and I am in an incredible mood for 
    descent food.”</i> Rosanne said. I suggested going for the food first. 
    Although I wasn’t hungry at all, I knew eating would help me to get on my 
    feet again. After dinner we gladly found a small hotel. Rosanne started to 
    badger me about uploads. As if I didn’t fancy one. <i>“Women stop that.”</i> 
    Was the only thing I could come up with. After half an hour she started 
    again. <i>“We must make a plan for tomorrow.” </i>And with several corny 
    jokes she tried to cheer me up.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I realized as well 
    that something constructive had to happen, but I still couldn’t think 
    clearly. I felt so sick. As a sick navigator in a small boat on a wild sea:
    <i>“I have to think clearly, but my brains don’t cooperate. I can’t even 
    count two and five together. Don’t even mention making a plan.”</i> I had to 
    make a plan: I wished to speak to Kodjiro. I haven’t done all this work for 
    him for free and I still have that box somewhere at the airport in a depot. 
    And I want to have my money. I wanted to leave as soon as possible. <i>“Oh, 
    what a mess.”</i> Doubtfully I suggested searching for dr. Tachikawa. 
    According to Paul Bentley he is not to be trusted, but I hadn’t made this 
    journey for nothing, had I? Rosanne insisted in my plan. I wanted to walk. 
    Then I could think and get my thoughts organized. Walking is good. The one 
    step after the other and slowly you continue. No rush. But Rosanne wanted to 
    go as fast as ever, best with a cab. We came to a compromise. If we wouldn’t 
    be there after an hour, we would take a cab. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The long walk through 
    the streets of Tokyo really helped me. After half an hour I could relax a 
    bit. I still hadn’t seen much of the city and I started to ask Rosanne 
    several questions about monuments and buildings we past. On our way we 
    stopped at a small noodles restaurant to eat something. I felt better every 
    time. I think it helped Rosanne as well. She started to tell more and more 
    enthusiastic about everything. Suddenly she sat down. In the middle of the 
    street. I was shocked and thought she would be completely confused again. I 
    wanted to pull her up. The cars left and right were almost hitting her. I 
    panicked. Then she raised her hand and a cab stopped next to her. She looked 
    at me with this challenging look. <i>“Come on, get in”</i> she said smiling.
    <i>“We have walked for more than seventy minutes. Now it’s my turn.”</i></span></p>
