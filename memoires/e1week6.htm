     Yes, I have fulfilled the tests with success! The team didn’t need so much 
     time to come up with this decision. Jessica came out of the conference room 
     within the hour to tell me the good news. Directly after the celebrations I 
     had to sign several contracts in which I signed for my agreement to undergo 
     a surgical operation in the benefit of Braintec’s research. So now I am an 
     official test subject. They didn’t take time to ask me if I was still 
     interested to go further on this road, but of course I could protest or 
     refuse to sign any contract if I wanted to. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Despite the information 
    they gave me earlier, I’m not scheduled for the operation tomorrow morning 
    but the day after that. Tomorrow didn’t suit the surgeon and they want to 
    test me one more time. At two o’clock I have an appointment with a 
    hypnotizer who’s going to test how easily I can be hypnotized. I might be an 
    eligible candidate for a MESI-implant if that man is satisfied about my 
    abilities. That kind of implant is a bit bigger than the usual MSI, through 
    which it can also extract data out of the brains and store it in little 
    plates, the M-stores. That is how they collect the memories for the 
    experiments. Not everybody is suitable for a MESI, because you have to be in 
    deep hypnosis during an extraction. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">And not everybody can be 
    hypnotized so deeply. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">That means that 
    I might be ably to choose between the two kinds of implants after this 
    hypnosis session. Tomorrow evening I will be admitted to the left wing of 
    the Center, the hospital department. And I will be cut open the morning 
    after. Exciting!</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Almost directly after I 
    signed the contracts, I went to town for a drink with some of the team 
    members. Not in order to celebrate my connection to the team, at least not 
    for them. </span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">They go to 
    town quit often. For me it was the first time. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">I was very glad to leave the Center after 
    three days and three nights in close confinement. From now on, I will get 
    more freedom unless I drink more than three alcoholics at one evening or 
    during the next test periods. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Portland is a funny 
    place to be. Very American, with a clean outside and a reserved inside. That 
    is at least how I see it. I have seen some parts of the town during the trip 
    from the airport towards the Research </span>
    <span style="font-family:
  Arial">Center</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">, but the city center was completely new for me. It was nice to sit at 
    the bar with these people. They were less reserved than during working hours 
    and the conversations became more personal. I’m not sure if they are now my 
    colleagues or my employers. </span></p>
