    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Davel keeps me 
    worrying more often. I feel it is my duty as a good counselor to discuss 
    this in the team. Fortunately I was not the only one who was not sure about 
    his health. Sheila automatically assisted me in my remarks. <i>“Sometimes he 
    seems to be separated far from reality,”</i> she completed my sentence<i>. 
    “Then he talks about worlds he clearly sees in front of him but for us 
    totally nonsense. I have the impression they are hallucinations.”</i> 
    Although Steward did not think it wise to let him stop the pills. <i>“If he 
    really deals with symptoms of neurological deviations, then a shortage of 
    medication will mean every man for himself.” </i>Dr. Hamilton suggessted 
    giving Davel a few hypno-sessions. Hoping that this will create more 
    assurance about the existence of these images. In that case we can make sure 
    that we deal with temporarily hallucinations or that there is any possible 
    connection to his unconscious. We asked Lucas to keep himself busy with that.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">For Lucas it is not 
    clear to him what he is supposed to do. Maybe it is not clear to anybody yet 
    and perhaps we better should be waiting further instructions for the time 
    being. He knows a lot about self-hypnosis and about the unconscious. That is 
    obvious. But is he willing to share his knowledge with us and promote it for 
    Braintec? For the time being he seems to wait and see which way the wind 
    blows. I can imagine that. It is really something to leave for Portland just 
    like that. I do realize that it is not easy for anyone of us to find its way 
    here. Sometimes we almost look like a sect. A strange kind of scientology 
    community.</span></p>
