    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">It 
    was a memory of Adelle with her niece. But so heavy and it doesn’t stop. It 
    goes on and on. I understood these memories would only stay in my mind for a 
    couple of seconds and that I would get rid of it right after. But no, they 
    stay. It is even more than a memory. A couple of hours after Adelle’s memory 
    I got more. I knew or felt that I was divorced. I knew that already as 
    Adelle had told me herself. But now I felt it as well. Very strange and even 
    frightening. I don’t want this at all and I don’t think this is normal. Not 
    how it’s supposed to be. Therefore I spoke to Sheila about this. She was 
    worried and she wanted to know all about it. I had to do a test as well. I 
    had to answer all kinds of questions on the computer. All different kinds of 
    subjects. How things go at home, and how it used to be. I don’t know why she 
    gave me that test and I’m not sure how I did it. Didn’t I make the same test 
    earlier, about the first day I arrived? I’m afraid something is going wrong. 
    I hope there’s something they can do about it.</span></p>
