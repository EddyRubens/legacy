		Member,<br>
		This letter is to inform all who read it that I, Sonja Boutoille, have 
		been kidnapped by Dr. Tachikawa. I want to inform all who are new and 
		all who stay by will, that Braintec is only part of a much larger 
		organization called MemoCorp. I have heard them say they are inventing 
		equipment for the Pentagon and the CIA which can allow us to shoot a 
		smaller version of our implants into someone's head, at a distance of 
		200 meters. This is a means of warfare that Dr. Tachikawa had been 
		working on before he was fired from the CIA. </span>
		<span style="font-family:Arial">He continued his practice, only changing 
		the name to Braintec, to fool all those involved and retrieve many 
		extractions. If this smaller version is to be used as a 'bullet' implant, 
		the owning country could certainly monopolize any country they wish with 
		their weapon of war. This is why Dr. Tachikawa is in such a hurry to 
		leave the United States. The invention was intended for their country, 
		but he has chosen to take it to Japan. I have proof that some test 
		subject have died from Dr. Tachikawa's experiments. I urge all who care 
		for their lives to get out now. I am sure to be murdered for partaking 
		in this leak of valuable information. I feel my life is expendable 
		should this information save the world. <br>

	I completely understand your hesitation sending information via Internet. I 
	am, however, unable to return to Oregon to retrieve information from you. I 
	will be leaving within the hour to catch a flight to Rome, which transfers 
	to Athens. I received information as to which flights Tachikawa has 
	planned.&nbsp;My hope is that I can reach Megan before she gets to Japan. <br>
	I felt you should know I received an email from someone named Josh. He 
	mentioned that you were using his computer and failed to log off. Under your 
	name, he apparently came across the first letter I sent you. His letter 
	asked many questions of who I was and what connections we had. I offered 
	only the necessary information and told him to contact you for further 
	details. <br>
	I have asked my new partner Agent David D. Davis, whom I mentioned in the 
	last letter, to fly out to Oregon and arrange for you and Carmen to be taken 
	out of the facility. My Commander in Chief has arranged for all of us with a MSI or MESI to fly to Sweden once everyone is safe and together. That is the 
	location of a team of highly honored and well known neurosurgeons who 
	specialize in complicated brain procedures. They are currently waiting our 
	arrival to safely remove our implants. They say the removal procedure is 99% 
	less hazardous than that of the implantation. They are guaranteeing a safe 
	and certain recovery for us all, even Carmen with her 'special ' situation.
	<br>
	I hope all of this is good news for you. Make sure you and Carmen are packed 
	and ready to go once Agent Davis arrives.&nbsp;I will meet with you and Carmen in 
	Maine when I have found Megan.<br>

		It is Kaleb. I will be sharing this name, that of a fellow CIA agent, 
		located in Maine. You probably are wondering what happened to Megan and 
		I. Tachikawa has taken her against her will. I had to leave Braintec 
		immediately in order to stay on his trail. In Nova Scotia, I was able to 
		free Megan for a short time. We left the airport and headed to the 
		parking lot. There, Tachikawa found us and used a car as a weapon 
		against me.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to survive the collision into the car. I 
		don't remember much after that. I do not know where Megan is now. I am 
		writing to let you know that I am doing all that I can to help your 
		friend. I have not abandoned you and Carmen. If you have any information 
		that could help, please email me at this address. I will be working with 
		Agent David D. Davis. He or myself can be trusted with any information 
		you might have.<br>

        I found out that the extraction that is planned for me, will take place 
        at 5:30 this evening. I don't know what will take place during this 
        experiment and I am very much afraid. When I came to Braintec, I had 
        imagined it to be a fun and interesting experience, like it was in the 
        beginning. I never had any idea that one day I would be fearful of my 
        life, my sanity and my freedom. How did I get myself trapped in such a 
        horrible place? I can't even rely on my family, for I fear that Dr. 
        Tachikawa will harm them as well. He has to be breaking some kind of law. 
        I know I am from Russia, but I was taught that America was 'The Land of 
        Freedom.' Was I taught wrong all those years? I am trying to stay 
        positive, but it very hard. Good Luck tonight with the Agents!&nbsp; Megan</span></font></p>

        I am not sure if she will be able to make it to dinner with Carmen, the 
        agents, and you. The doctors have planned some sort of experimental 
        extraction. I am very frightened. I want to tell them to please let me 
        go home, but Dr. Tachikawa has gotten very physical with me. When I 
        returned from our meeting in the Gardens, he grabbed me by my upper arms 
        and shook me while yelling at me. He was mad because I refused to tell 
        him where I was. Then he demanded my father's address in Russia. I would 
        not give it to him in fear he will search for him and do him harm. When 
        he realized I would not give in, he pushed me to the floor. I have 
        horrible bruises on my arms and think I bruised my tailbone when I hit 
        the floor. I have been locked inside my room since then. I will try to 
        email you in the morning. If you do not hear from me, please search to 
        see that I am okay.&nbsp; Megan</span></font></p>

    It is to our understanding that you, as well as others, are involved in an 
    organization which involves memory recall. This is an experiment that a 
    former scientist and colleague of the CIA was involved with. When terminated 
    for specific reasons, he took with him some of the highly sensitive 
    equipment used in this procedure and many of the M-stores. (These were the 
    extracted and stored memories of CIA 'Test Subjects.') We are still 
    uncertain if any of the Doctors or Scientists in your facility are the 
    specific person who stole these materials from the CIA. We have only written 
    to few 'members' belonging to Braintec . We do not want anyone to be 
    suspicious. If he was to flee again, our many months of surveillance will 
    have gone to waste. We only wish to apprehend this criminal and return the 
    equipment and any, if not all of the 'Test Subjects' to a safe and highly 
    monitored facility. We are writing to you to ask for your help. Please 
    respond.<br>
