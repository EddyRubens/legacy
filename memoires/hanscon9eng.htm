    <span style="font-family: Arial">What do we have to do in Japan? Nothing 
    until now, Paul says. </span><font face="Arial">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">What do you mean doing nothing, asked 
    Heather. Because there is still so much uncertain about Braintec, Paul 
    explained. Who is in the complot and who is a victim? That is hard to find 
    out. Only about the founder, Professor Hamilton, we certainly know it’s a 
    scoundrel. The others are probably in his power since the operation. About 
    your contact person, Rosanne, we know for example that she had been an 
    honest girl until now. Maybe she still is, but she might be under the 
    influence of the MESI-implant and so much under the influence of Braintec 
    that she would only do what professor Hamilton and his mates are saying. 
    About the Japanese branch my colleagues of the Japanese police don’t know 
    much yet. It is a much closed group. They keep not-operated people outside. 
    The leader, dr. Tachikawa, has a good scientific reputation but is also a 
    former member of a sect which want to go back to the ancient Japan. </span>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The 
    two of you aren’t surgically operated but you have everything that resembles 
    the operated Brainteccers. That is a way to get entrance to the Japanese 
    group. We have to do that carefully though. If you just go to there you 
    wouldn’t be trusted. How could you get their address? With the Japanese 
    police we thought of another strategy. We electronically spread out the 
    message that you’re sent to Japan for a specific recall. We are going to do 
    that in such way that they’ll become curious and search for contact with you. 
    Through your laptop we are able now to enter their system. To know more it 
    is necessary to connect that laptop directly with their computer. What do 
    you have to do now? You’ll get two credit cards through which you can pay. 
    There is electronics in it through which FBI and the Japanese police can 
    hold a track on you. Behave like tourists who want to experience as much as 
    possible to be able to recall that later on. Do not search for any contact 
    with us, that is only dangerous. As soon as dr. Tachikawa or someone else 
    wants to make contact you can just go with them. Keep your eyes and ears 
    open and paste the laptop back on your body. Then connect the laptop to 
    their computer. You can say that it’s a way to let the Japanese join the 
    recall. I will leave you now, you are strong enough to find out for yourself. 
    Paul went to the front of the plane fast. Heather, can we do this and do we 
    want to? Two times yes, she says. Do you know much about Japan? The 
    literature, the art and music I know, but the society is strange to me. That 
    is going to be a real exploration. </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The 
    airport isn’t much different than other airports. The signs are fortunately 
    in English as well. There is someone at the pass control indeed who arranges 
    our visa and looks at us penetrating. Besides that he doesn’t do anything. 
    There is also a tourist information where a lovely smiling Japanese informs 
    us extensive. A hotel in an area with a lot of galleries and museums seems 
    the best to us. We take the train to the center and then the bus to the 
    hotel we choose. Signs we cannot read, but the numbers on the busses are 
    fortunately the same as ours. </span></font></p>
