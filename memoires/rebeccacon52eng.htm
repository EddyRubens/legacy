    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It's morning already 
    and I wish that this evening would hurry up and arrive. I am worried that 
    the doctors have an idea of what might be taking place tonight. Why else 
    would Carmen and I both be scheduled for uploads? When I woke up, I found 
    two notes which had been slid under the door. There was a one for Carmen and 
    a one for me.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When I woke Carmen up 
    to show her, we noticed how close our uploads were, mine was scheduled for 
    3:00pm, and Carmen's was scheduled for 4:00pm. One right after the other. 
    Then I couldn't help but remember what Megan had said last night. She 
    mentioned that Dr. Tachikawa was planning some sort of experimental 
    extraction. I wonder if they had any plans for this Kaleb guy as well. When 
    I decided to check my emails, I saw there was one from Megan. I hurried to 
    open it. It read; <i>&quot;Rebecca I found out that the extraction that is 
    planned for me, will take place at 5:30 this evening. I don't know what will 
    take place during this experiment and I am very much afraid. When I came to 
    Braintec, I had imagined it to be a fun and interesting experience, like it 
    was in the beginning. I never had any idea that one day I would be fearful 
    of my life, my sanity and my freedom. How did I get myself trapped in such a 
    horrible place? I can't even rely on my family, for I fear that Dr. 
    Tachikawa will harm them as well. He has to be breaking some kind of law. I 
    know I am from Russia, but I was taught that America was 'The Land of 
    Freedom.' Was I taught wrong all those years? I am trying to stay positive, 
    but it very hard. Good Luck tonight with the Agents!&nbsp; Megan&quot;</i></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Poor Megan. I must try 
    to think of a way to get her out of that extraction. Carmen and I are 
    planning to make contact with Kaleb today. Hopefully all will go well.</span></p>
