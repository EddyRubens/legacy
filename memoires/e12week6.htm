    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">I had 
    a long talk with Jessica. She’s worried about the side effects of the 
    uploads. I myself was under the impression that there are a lot less than a 
    few weeks ago. I hardly get headaches and the nausea is completely gone. But 
    that wasn’t what Jessica meant. She suspects the uploads might be addictive 
    and she’s worried about possible long term effects. For that reason she’s 
    suggested to give them a rest. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I jumped up in anger 
    when she told me this. I exploded. <i>“How dare you! You think you can use 
    your authority as a psychologist against me this way?”</i> Jessica looked at 
    me expressionless.&nbsp; <i>“I know you hate it that I fancy Kodjiro and not you, 
    but now you’ve really gone too far.”</i> Jessica walked toward the basin to 
    get a glass of water and put it on the table in front of me. I almost threw 
    it back at her. Thankfully I could just about control myself and fell back 
    into the chair, feeling dejected. My violent reaction had only confirmed her 
    point. I took a few gulps and tried to relax. <i>“Dear Rosanne,”</i> Jessica 
    began, <i>“you’re absolutely right concerning my feelings for you and 
    Tachikawa, but in this case it has nothing to do with it. I’m really 
    concerned about you and I wouldn’t want things to get out of hand. Please 
    believe me.”</i> I really wanted to stay angry and leave that stuffy little 
    room, but I knew she was right. It takes no more than two days to get me bad 
    tempered when I haven’t had an upload. And my experiences with the amusement 
    park memory were so overpowering that the world around me was becoming 
    totally irrelevant. When I talked to Jessica about it I underplayed it. 
    After all, she has the power to convince the team to remove my implant if 
    she thinks it’s necessary. If that were to happen I could never relive 
    memories again. I’ll have to preserve my friendship with Jessica.</span></p>
