    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After a sleepless 
    night I realized I became none the wiser. I decided to check out. This small 
    space makes me sad. I guess I’d rather go out and face danger. The boy 
    behind the hotel desk called out something I couldn’t understand. I turned 
    around and saw he was waving something. It was mail. For me. Hurriedly I 
    opened the envelope. A small note fell to the floor. <i>“</i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">Osaka 
    station 12:30 pm. Paul Bentley.”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    The boy couldn’t remember exactly when it had been delivered. It might have 
    been yesterday evening. I needed to move fast! </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">A 
    really classy looking train took me to Osaka, an industrial city southwest 
    of Tokyo. I was a bit nervous. Maybe it won’t be the FBI agent waiting there 
    for me, but a Japanese platoon! Still, I could enjoy seeing a bit of the 
    landscape, as it flew by. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Still nervous, I got 
    off the train. Nobody standing out from the crowd… I was thirsty so I bought 
    a bottle of mineral water. After drinking half of it, I saw Paul. He 
    gestured me to follow him. About a hundred meter further he held open a door 
    for me. A sort of service entrance. We passed through another door and there 
    I saw Sonja en Adrian! They stood by a coffee machine chatting. I said hello 
    and we all hugged. It was nice to see each other again. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Paul came right to the 
    point. Today was going to be the big day. He told us to listen carefully or 
    people would probably die. <i>“Hans en Heather have arrived safely in 
    Portland by now,”</i> Paul said. <i>“We’re next. Escape is useless if the 
    evil isn’t extinguished. That’s what we’ll be taking care of today.”</i> 
    Like an experienced secret agent Paul took us through the plan. With a 
    little adjustment a portable extractor is able to record memories in 
    real-time, in other words; you can store the memories to an M-Store as they 
    happen. Adrian and I are supposed to jump off an apartment building, using a 
    small parachute. The fall will be recorded live. Then we’ll be given an 
    anesthetic and we’ll be clinically dead. That will be recorded as well. 
    Those two moments will be stored in sequence on M-Stores. Sonja will hand 
    these over as evidence to the Canadian, showing her assignment to kill me is 
    fulfilled. When it turns out she has also helped to kill Adrian and has 
    supplied the first recorded dying memories on M-Stores as well, they will 
    trust her sufficiently. Then all we need to do is waiting for the next 
    meeting to happen. Paul apparently has information confirming this meeting 
    will take place tonight. If the FBI can receive information from Sonja about 
    the location, all the Braintec baddies may be arrested as soon as tonight.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    sounded too good to be true. <i>“But what if something goes wrong?”</i> 
    Adrian wanted to know. <i>“Nothing will go wrong.”</i> Paul answered him. He 
    took out the adjusted extractor and showed us how to use it. The record 
    function was set to automatically switch off as soon as the parachute would 
    open. We didn’t have to worry about that. Adrian and I exchanged a doubtful 
    look. Are we doing this? It appeared the choice was already made for us.
