    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">It 
    was just like re-reading a book; I recognized some of the scenes and knew 
    what was going to come. Still my experience of this upload was quite 
    different from the previous one. Just as impressive, but less intense. I 
    became that child in an ideal world again. I felt as if my dreams were 
    coming true. Again, it was a pleasant experience and when it ended I removed 
    the adhesives from my head feeling quite satisfied. Steward asked the usual 
    questions while Dr. Tachikawa questioned me extensively about the difference 
    between the two uploads. When we were finished, he suddenly said: <i>“Let’s 
    do it again.”</i> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Two uploads in one day, 
    that had never been done before and especially not so close together! <i>
    “Yes, why not?”</i> he added enthusiastically. <i>“We could try to focus on 
    a specific aspect. I’m really curious as to whether that would work or not.”</i> 
    Steward was a bit reluctant but almost immediately started preparing the 
    machines for the second session. Nobody asked me. Maybe they saw it written 
    all over my face. After all I can’t get enough of these experiences. <i>
    “What do I focus on?”</i> I asked Dr. Tachikawa. <i>“Choose an object, 
    something detailed.” “A roller coaster cart?”</i> I suggested. <i>“Perfect!”</i> 
    Getting back into the re-experience the amusement park had a familiar feel 
    to it. I almost immediately got to the ride and stood at the side watching 
    the carts go by. The people in the carts were screaming excitedly and the 
    wheels made an impressive sound. I loved those carts. There, another one 
    zoomed past me. The sound was actually a bit too loud, but that made it all 
    the more exciting. I have cars at home but those are different. I like 
    pushing them. And I love daddy’s car. I wanted to stay and watch the carts 
    speed by but mommy pulled me along. On we went. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Dr. Tachikawa was 
    very happy with the new results as well as my report. As I’m writing I can 
    still feel the rush of excitement and I’ve got something to be surprised 
    about again. The memory of a collection of cars that I’m supposed to have 
    played with seems a lot more real than my memories of the cuddly toys from 
    my own childhood.</b> </span>
