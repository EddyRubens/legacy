    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Last night, when 
    Carmen and I got back to the facility, we had a long talk about Davel, the 
    implants, and things of that nature. I think she picked up on the fact that 
    I was a bit nervous to have heard about the whole Davel-Pirate story. <i>&quot;I 
    don't think they messed him up,&quot;</i> she said, <i>&quot;I think he was just 
    smokin or tokin, if you know what I mean!&quot;</i>&nbsp; She sure knows how to 
    lighten a situation! I felt better after our chat and again became excited 
    about being here!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">This morning I was 
    called into Sheila's office. Dr. Hamilton was there as well. <i>&quot;Good news!&quot;</i> 
    Dr. Hamilton said, <i>&quot;We would like to welcome you to our Braintec family!&quot;</i> 
    He seemed to be in a surprisingly good mood. I looked at him for a moment, 
    deciding whether or not I should burst out with, 'Daddy!'&nbsp; I decided against 
    it, for who knows if it would have spoiled his good mood. <i>&quot;I'm assuming I 
    passed all the tests?&quot;</i> I said instead. He shook his head in a positive 
    motion while smiling and looking over what must have been my file. Sheila 
    said <i>&quot;The staff is very excited to have you here because you are quite 
    different from the other test subjects.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot;</i> Dr. Hamilton interrupted,
    <i>&quot;you see, you are the first test subject we will have that exhibits any 
    obvious fears!&nbsp; </i>(I cringed because somehow knew this was coming!) <i>If 
    you allow us to insert the MESI implant we will be able to extract a memory 
    when you have had.......... </i>(there was a pause while he looked down into 
    the file)<i>....... an 'attack,' as you call them. This will enable us to 
    upload your 'attack' memory to a willing testee to see how they react. This 
    might also allow us to better understand how you feel when these 'attacks' 
    happen and maybe possibly find a way to rid them from your life!&quot;</i> The 
    first thing I thought was <i>&quot;Why does he project the word 'attack' then 
    leave a short pause before continuing his sentence?&quot; </i>Then I thought of 
    ridding these fears from my life was too good to be true. However, I didn't 
    know what to say. The MESI implant was the one I was hoping to receive, only 
    not particularly under these circumstances. <i>&quot;I guess that's what being a 
    test subject is all about, letting the doctors test their theories.&quot;</i> I 
    said. Dr. Hamilton looked at Sheila and then back at me. He was smiling from 
    ear to ear!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I went back to my room 
    with a pass to the &quot;Left Wing' in hand. I was told to pack up my stuff, 
    because I was going to be moved to a bigger room away from the new arrivals. 
    I assumed this was a good thing. When I told Dr. Hamilton that Carmen and I 
    would still like to share a room he was more than happy to oblige. The good 
    thing about Dr. Hamilton being so enthusiastic about this is he would like 
    me to have the surgery in two days. Carmen had decided to take the MESI 
    implant as well. She told me the date and time of her implant. Turns out her 
    surgery is right before mine, on the same day. I joked with her saying they 
    needed to do a 'rough draft' before they dare touch their new 'Star Subject' 
    She laughed and threw her 'Carmen pillow' at me.&nbsp;</span></p>
