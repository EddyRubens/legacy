    <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-weight: 700">Davel can really 
    drink, my God! More or less the fact that I was worried or just that I was 
    simply curious, I invited him to come downtown. He said he loved to see 
    Elisa’s bar. Adrian told him all about it. But since I have been throwing 
    chairs there.&nbsp; I’m not welcome anymore. So we decided going to Geno's. 
    Fine to me. We settled down at the bar, close to the source.</span></p>

    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">After three whiskies on the rocks we got 
    in high spirits. Davel told me almost everything about all sorts of 
    experiences. I didn’t get the clue. Was he talking about his personal 
    experiences or about his uploads? It didn’t matter to me. He seemed to enjoy 
    himself here and could hardly stop telling his stories. A few times I tried 
    to get in between to share his story and letting him know I was listening. 
    Bad luck. He kept on going. The only thing that could stop his vocabulary 
    was a full cyst. I laughed at him when he was waggling to the toilets. 
    Strange guy. He looks rather young to me. However, I like him. It’s great to 
    see his happy face and playfulness. I went to the toilets as well. Suddenly 
    he grabbed me from behind. His arm squeezed my throat and I almost fell off 
    the crutch caused by this clumsy embrace. <i>“Shall we go to my room?”</i> 
    he asked and with the little breath left I answered it was alright with me. 
    As long as he would let me breath. Davel paid the bill and refused any 
    contribution from my side. So young and already a real gentleman! </span>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">We took a taxi to his apartment. Davel 
    has fear of company and prefers not to stay at the Research Centre. Since he 
    was dismissed from the left wing, he took residence in here. I was shocked 
    by the great mess. Old pizza boxes and wraps of other food all over the 
    place. Some empty beer-cans here and there. Davel found a bottle of vodka 
    almost full and a bottom full of whisky between other bottles. I preferred 
    vodka. The strength of this liquid softens your throat in such a delightful 
    way and warms up your throat. Davel started talking again. This time about 
    his fear for people and why he does not feel comfortable with most people. 
    You are an exception, he said. He does felt comfortable with me. Yes, for 
    sure, alcohol seemed to take away all kinds of borders, I thought. Also mine 
    for just a few seconds later I was massaging his back. His skin was young 
    and pliable feeling like elastic. If he would like to, he could be a model 
    easily. I’m always afraid that beautiful boys think they can make love to 
    any girl they meet. Maybe the reason I rather prefer older men. Each part of 
    the body wears an experience. I like that. </span></p>

    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">I think I felt asleep as a log after 
    Davel gave me a massage. I can hardly remember anything about it. What I do 
    know is the fact that I woke up the next morning at 11 a.m. while I had this 
    appointment at </span><span style="font-family:
