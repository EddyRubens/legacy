    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">That 
    does it! What do they think they are? I am furious, deeply hurt and 
    completely mad about. Wait, I’ll start at the beginning.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I went for a drink 
    with Adrian to the so-called Elisa’s bar. Honestly I was much too tired and 
    rather preferred to go to bed early. But Adrian insisted and said he could 
    not wait any longer. He definitely had something to tell me. So we got into 
    one of the cars and drove to the centre. <i>“Which bar shall we go?”</i> 
    Adrian asked. <i>“Elisa’s of course!”</i> I answered determined. Since 
    Adrian had been there with Jessica he had invited me already six times to go 
    there once. Why bother asking which direction we’re heading for. Adrian 
    seemed to hesitate for a while but finally parked the car in the area where 
    that vague bar was situated. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">There we were, in 
    Elisa’s cafe. It was a good place indeed. Very different to others and 
    everybody seemed to know each other. I looked at Adrian wondering what he 
    had to say. What actually did he wanted to tell me? He cleared his throat 
    and took another zip from his beer. He seemed to have a problem with it. I 
    was getting a bit nervous. Maybe it was something terrible. Maybe Kodjiro 
    died and therefore I had not seen him yet. <i>“Here, here it was,”</i> he 
    mumbled. <i>“Here, at this table they were sitting. Adelle and I saw it.”</i> 
    Adrian played with his package of shag which I bought for him. He was afraid 
    to look at me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>“Who, Adrian?”</i> 
    I asked. <i>“Whom did you see?”</i> In one movement Adrian stood up and hit 
    the package of shag on the table. <i>“Jessica and Tachikawa.” </i>He looked 
    at me, straight into my eyes. My heart began to beat faster and faster and 
    my body became one bundle of nerves. <i>“Together they were sharing a bottle 
    of champagne, well, actually, hugging each other.”</i> I looked as if I was 
    struck by lightening. Background music, romantic lights, everything was 
    crystal-clear and so bright that it hurt me. <i>“Impossible!”</i> I shouted 
    and stood up. The amount of adrenaline in my body got multiplied. <i>“And on 
    the table I saw an envelop of </i></span><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Japan Airlines.”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    Adrian whispered. <i>“No, you are lying!”</i>&nbsp; I shouted and I could no 
    longer control myself. <i>“Filthy liar! You are a filthy, filthy liar! That’s 
    what you are</i>!” </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Ratio is hardly to 
    find when so much energy is flowing through your body. I had to do something. 
    Wiggling my left leg to my right leg was not enough. Then I imagined. 
    Jessica was laughing very loud and reached over to Kodjiro. Kodjiro brushed 
    through her hair and gave her a kiss on her forehead. <i>“No!!!”</i> I 
    screamed. <i>“Impossible!”</i> Before I understood was I was doing I already 
    had been throwing the first chair. It fell on the ground with a much noise. 
    I took another chair and threw it against the table unoccupied next to us. 
    That felt so good. Adrian tried to stop me when I reached for a third chair. 
    I got rid of him and I slammed the chair as much as I could across the room. 
    When it hit the wall one leg broke. One painting fell off and glass 
    everywhere. The few people there were all watching me. Anger was gone. I 
    felt small and very empty.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Adrian put a hand on 
    my shoulder. I turned towards his direction and burst into tears. Every 
    choke came from my toes and never stopped. On the spot where I pressed my 
    face against Adrian’s blouse became soaking wet. <i>“How’s possible? 
    Kodjiro, my Kodjiro,”</i> I sniffed. <i>“Is it really true?” “Yes, Rosanne,”</i> 
    Adrian replied. <i>“I’m afraid so.”</i> And again tears were running. I felt 
    miserable. Adrian suggested to go for a walk. In a few seconds I had caused 
    an enormous ruin which was not fully appreciated. When Adrian put some extra 
    money on the bar, Elisa said that he should not bother taking me next time. 
    I don’t care anymore. There won’t be any next time. Nothing mattered to me 
    anymore.</span></p>
