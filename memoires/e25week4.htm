    Couldn’t find a better sleeping-place than the metro-station. My rucksack 
    and sleeping-bag made clear I was no tramp. Maybe the guards left me alone 
    for that reason. Some alcoholics drinking sake were kindly but stern 
    requested to leave the place immediately. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Worn out caused by 
    this difficult uncomfortable night I grabbed my stuff and put it in the 
    locker again. More than two hours before it opened I was waiting in front of 
    the Virgin to check my email. Minutes went slow. Tokyo is a strange city. 
    Everybody is friendly and polite. But still this kind of world is hard on 
    me. If you do not follow the rules and expectations, you are out of the 
    system. And somebody who is, is lost. I was hungry. I had only a few yen 
    left. Not enough for a dish of ‘ramen’. And an ordinary apple was even much 
    more expensive. I had just enough money left to travel to the office where I 
    donated my blood yesterday. Waiting and hunger were giving me such a hard 
    time that I loved to spent my last money getting there again.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I was the only ‘customer’. 
    Again he was there, the doctor in his white coat, and he recognized me. He 
    told me most people get injected in the evening. <i>“Then they get drunk 
    much faster.”</i> I nodded understanding and gratefully I accepted the 
    shake. The thick sweet liquid I swallowed with great effort yesterday, 
    tasted delicious. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">To 
    my big surprise the doctor gave me, apart from the money, a drawn street 
    map. <i>“Blaintek,”</i> he said, and he pointed at a circled small cross. I 
    could kiss the man but instead I deeply bowed forward. In this country I 
    think it this is a better way of expressing your gratitude. We shook hands 
    again and the doctor emphasized that I could have my blood tested only once 
    in twenty-four hours. <i>“With a bit of luck I don’t need that anymore!”</i> 
    I answered enthusiastically. He looked at me rather disappointed. <i>“But I 
    may return of course for the benefit of it all…”</i> I completed my words on 
    the spot. The doctor nodded a few times and showed his teeth. He didn’t 
    believe that, obviously. Sun was shining more brightly now. Maybe it’s gonna 
    be a beautiful day after all.</span></p>
