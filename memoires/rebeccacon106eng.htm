	There was no doubt in my mind, the other shadow had to be Jacobs. 
	My thoughts seemed to be floating and I was struggling to grab them. It 
	seemed the one I was able to grasp was the deliberation as to where Thomas 
	was. 
	Even though Thomas was pretty damn strong and could handle himself in almost 
	any situation, Jacobs was a lot bigger than him. And, even if they were 
	having a fair match up, Andrews most likely got involved, out numbering 
	Thomas, and helped Jacobs bring him down. I wanted to rush to his aide as he 
	did for me, but there was no way out past Andrews and Jacobs. </span>

	<i>&quot;OK princess,&quot;</i> Andrews said. &quot;<i>If that's how you 
	want to play...just read the note we're giving you.... and..... make sure 
	you make the right choice. </i>(A piece of folded paper slid under the door)<i>.....Cause 
	next time you and you new little boyfriend won't be so lucky. You'll both 
	end up like that jerk-off agent's twin brother. Get my drift?....and 
	Uh,....I know, you know, what I'm talking about!&quot; </i>After that, I heard them walking away. But Andrews managed to yell back to 
	me, <i>&quot;I'll be sure to tell Josh about your new boyfriend. I'm sure he'd like 
	to hear all about what's going on&quot;</i>....then laughing.</span><p class="MsoNormal">

	When I thought they were gone, I turned on the light. I put the dumbbell 
	down and grabbed the (newly noticed) baseball bat behind the door. What was 
	I thinking with that dumbbell anyway? I could never have lifted that thing 
	to swing at someone!
	I grabbed the folded paper, and shoved it into my pocket with the Band-Aid 
	box, Then slowly opened the door. I inched the door, little by little until 
	I was positive no one was there. I ran back down the hall towards my room, 
	baseball bat in hand, praying to find Thomas in one piece. 
	When I got there, I found him beaten and tied to the safety grip handle in 
	the shower. <i>&quot;Oh Thomas!&quot;</i> I said as I started to cry. <i>&quot;No time for tears girl,&quot;</i> he replied. 
	<i>&quot;Hurry and untie me, we gotta find 
	Jerry!&quot;</i></span><i><span lang="NL-BE" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></i><p class="MsoNormal">
