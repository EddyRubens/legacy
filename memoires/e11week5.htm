    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><b>We have just had 
    some violence here. Dr. Hamilton and Dr. Tachikawa had a fight. I don’t know 
    how this happened exactly, but their argument was about that article in the 
    Scientific American. Dr. Tachikawa blamed Dr. Hamilton for not mentioning 
    his name, while it was his invention. And he seemed to have gathered a lot 
    of irritations during the last months, which he all poured out. It must have 
    bothered him a lot, ‘coss he started to throw with everything. The quarrel 
    became heated.</b> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">I haven’t seen this 
    fight myself, but I have heard it. It was an enormous shouting and throwing 
    match. I had just left my room, where I put some cream on my sleep. When I 
    heard the noise, I rushed quickly towards it. They were in the coffee room, 
    in front of a dozen test subjects and several colleagues. Everyone who wasn’t 
    already there came running in as quickly as possible, to find out what was 
    happening. At the time I arrived it was almost over. <i>“If this thing 
    continuous, it might perhaps be better if I start for myself!”</i> Dr. 
    Tachikawa screamed. He gestured that we had to get out of his way and walked 
    away furiously. Dr. Hamilton stayed behind flabbergasted. He suddenly seemed 
    to be ten years older. Dr. Tachikawa was almost around the corner when I got 
    the impulse to follow him. <i>“Kodjiro!”</i> I shouted and rushed towards 
    him. <i>“Kodjiro, wait!”</i> This was the first time that I called him by 
    his surname. That was probably the reason why he halted abruptly. He took a 
    deep breath, turned around and took my face in his hands. <i>“Maybe we 
    should leave this place together.”</i> he whispered and he kissed me on my 
    forehead. He softly caressed my temple and muttered some excuse. Then he 
    continued walking, with his head down. Again, I felt the impulse to follow 
    him, but I didn’t do it this time. It might be better to leave him alone for 
    a while.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I lie down on my bed 
    to rethink what had happened today. Dr. Tachikawa’s response was way out of 
    proportion, I thought. Maybe Dr. Hamilton had mentioned his name and his 
    involvement during the interview. The reporter might have chosen to leave 
    that out of the article. But it was probably the last straw. What else had 
    filled his mind? And then that situation with Steward and my painful face. 
    Was Steward setting the two doctors against each other? &nbsp;Actually I should 
    be getting go to the coffee room, to hear what happened exactly. But I 
    prefer to stay in my bed right now. Dr. Tachikawa had kissed me. True, on my 
    forehead, but it still was a kiss. I get a warm feeling when I remember it. 
    Kodjiro.</span></p>
