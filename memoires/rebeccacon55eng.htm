    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Three o'clock came 
    sooner than expected. I think it was because we were both so nervous. 
    Together, Carmen and I headed towards the uploading rooms. On the way, we 
    were confirming what we were going to say if they asked any questions as to 
    why we wanted to be together. Carmen was planning on telling them that she 
    had a horrible premonition last night. She was going to say that she had the 
    feeling that something bad was going to happen. And, in her culture, (wink, 
    wink) it was a 'sign' sent to her as a warning. She was going to finish by 
    telling them she would just feel more comfortable if we could stay together. 
    As we were walking down the hall, I whispered to her <i>&quot;I wonder which room 
    they found Kasey in?&quot;</i> She whispered back that she didn't want to know. 
    When we reached the uploading room, the usual people were there, Dr. 
    Hamilton, Sheila, Stewart, and to my surprise, Dr. Tachikawa. I figured he 
    had more important things to do than watch an upload. (Things like, 
    torturing poor unknowing test subjects)</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The first thing Dr. 
    Hamilton said was, <i>&quot;I'm glad to see that you came.&quot; </i>I wanted to say 
    something rude back to him, but I just did a fake smile and answered, <i>&quot;You 
    know I wouldn't miss the opportunity to get an upload!&quot;</i> <i>&quot;Good answer,&quot;</i> 
    Dr. Tachikawa blurted out. He had one of his evil smiles again. I started to 
    feel sick to my stomach. I got a sudden feeling this was not going to be one 
    of the exciting or calm uploads I had received before. I grabbed Carmen's 
    hand and squeezed it. She gave my hand a reassuring squeeze before Steward 
    told me to get into the chair.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><i>&quot;Your little friend 
    can wait in the hall for her turn,&quot;</i> Dr. Tachikawa said. I looked at 
    Carmen. She cleared her throat then gave her 'It's a sign' story to them. 
    Sheila looked at Dr. Hamilton and rolled her eyes. I thought it was rude of 
    her to do that. She has been pretty cocky since Dr. Hamilton gave her the 
    bracelet he originally gave me.&nbsp; He shook his head in the 'Okay' motion and 
    told Carmen to just stay quiet and out of the way. <i>&quot;Absolutely not!&quot;</i> 
    Dr. Tachikawa yelled out. He pointed his finger towards the door and yelled 
    at Carmen, &quot;You go in the hall!&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I could tell Dr. 
    Hamilton was upset with him. He took Dr. Tachikawa in the hall and closed 
    the door. They were out there for about a minute or two then came back in. 
    Dr. Hamilton's face looked as though he was mad, but he returned calmly to 
    his seat. Dr. Tachikawa, on the other hand, came stomping in like a little 
    kid who didn't get his way. He purposely bumped into Carmen on his way back 
    over to his chair. Once Steward got everything in place, Carmen squeezed my 
    hand one last time. She took a few steps back, then the lights went to dim.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Within a second, I was 
    there. I was all alone in a dark room. I was little, about three or four. I 
    could feel myself crying. There was also another little voice, in a room 
    across the hall crying. My heart was aching because I knew the other person 
    crying, was my brother.&nbsp; Why were we apart? What did we do wrong? Mommy and 
    Daddy never put us in different rooms, even when we were being punished. I 
    was scared and confused. We were calling for each other, then for Mommy, and 
    then Daddy. Then I remember a big voice. It told us to <i>&quot;Pipe down and go 
    to sleep!&quot; </i>I grabbed my stuffed bear and squeezed him hard.&nbsp; Why did we 
    have to come here? I wanted to stay with Grandma and Grandpa! I was all 
    alone. My brother, I want my brother! .....Tears...Sadness... That was it.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When the lights came 
    on, I was crying. I looked at Dr. Tachikawa first. He was smiling of course.
    <i>&quot;Feeling sad and alone?&quot;</i> he said. <i>&quot;The world might turn on you. 
    Get use to it now!&quot;</i> Carmen came over had put her arm around me. &quot;You 
    Okay?&quot; she asked.&nbsp; I shook my head 'Yes' while wiping away the tears. I had 
    to explain what I saw and how I felt, as usual. Dr. Hamilton made a comment 
    about how this was a different M-Store than what he had planned. I didn't 
    have the energy to complain. We both </span>
    <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">knew who switched it.</span></p>
