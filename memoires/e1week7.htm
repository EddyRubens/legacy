    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">The only things 
    scheduled for today are my appointment with the hypnotist at two and my 
    admission to the left wing at 7 this evening. I’m off for the rest of the 
    day. This morning I tried to sleep in, but after 9 o’clock</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> all I did was toss and turn. All morning I’ve been imagining every 
    possible disaster scenario and came quite close to calling the whole thing 
    off. I took a walk in a beautiful Japanese garden not so far from here and 
    sat for quite a long time on a little bench there. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">My 
    life may never be the same after the operation. First they’ll pinpoint the 
    exact location with a Transcranial Magnetiser, and then drill a hole in my 
    skull to place the implant in the appropriate lobe. I find the drilling an 
    especially horrid idea. Like I’m Pinocchio. What if they go too deep or lose 
    their grip? I can’t bear to think about it. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">They’re trying to set 
    my mind at ease by comparing the operation to drilling holes in my ears or 
    placing tubes. But for those things they don’t need to open my skull! Even 
    if the technique had been used a thousand times without any complications, 
    it’s still creepy. What will be the side effects of that implant? The 
    futuristic aspect of this is something that I find very attractive, but what 
    if it goes wrong? The area of the brain where the MSI or MESI will be placed 
    will be in a confused state for a couple of weeks because of the damaged 
    junctions. After that it will adapt and new junctions will form. But what if 
    there is lasting damage? </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">On the other hand I 
    find this enterprise terribly exciting. I am so curious about what it will 
    be like to experience the memories of another person. I’m lucky to be able 
    to go through this experience, really!</span><span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp; </span>
