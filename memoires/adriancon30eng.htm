    <p Arial><font face="Arial">After 
    half an hour I suddenly became very curious. Should there be animal memories 
    on the other M-stores as well? I resembled the codes. That couldn't help me. 
    The numbers and letters had no connections at all. I had two other M-stores 
    with me and I decided to take another upload. </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial"><i>High in 
    the tree, at a branch. If I looked around me I saw fences everywhere. I 
    couldn't go far. Behind the fence I saw animals walking on two feet. Big and 
    small ones. They looked a bit like me, but they had less hair on their 
    bodies. But they where packed inside things, through which I couldn't see 
    how they looked like. Suddenly a door opened and a big bowl with fruit was 
    placed. I started to eat with my face away from the fence.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">These 
    weren't memories from test subjects but from laboratory animals. Of course, 
    before they experimented on human beings they did some tests on animals. It 
    was fun being a monkey for a while. That would say, that first time I was 
    enjoying myself. During the second upload I felled trapped by that cage 
    surrounding me. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">When I 
    stood up I suddenly felt very weird. My body wasn't in conjunction to what I 
    experienced. I seemed to be much too tall, too straight and too high. I 
    looked down to check the kind of body I was in. A human body, my body. I 
    stretched a couple of times and did some exercises. Then the strange feeling 
    disappeared. I was myself again.</span></p>
