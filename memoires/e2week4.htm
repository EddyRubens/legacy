    </span><span style="font-family:Arial">I smelled petrol, a thick brownish 
    smell with a green glow. I became all closed up and started sweating like 
    mad. I shook my head to the left and back in a continual movement that I 
    could not control. I made chewing noises and drooled. Very freaky, this, 
    although I was a bit sedated while it happened and felt absolutely no fear. 
    That came later, when I came to. Have I become epileptic? Did something go 
    wrong in my head after all?</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Dr. Hamilton told me 
    not to be afraid. An implant seldom is accepted into the body without 
    certain temporal neurological responses and this form of temporal epilepsy 
    regularly occurs. The lobe does not experience the implant as part of the 
    body and is struggling with it, as it were. I may experience another attack 
    but I should not worry. It’s a mild, harmless form of epilepsy that leaves 
    no traces. I won’t suffer any injuries. Except that annoying headache. The 
    thumping just won’t stop and the nurse can’t give me any more morphine. It 
    slows down the recovery process and has an addictive effect. As if I didn’t 
    know. </span></p>
