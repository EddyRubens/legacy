    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">My trip to Holland has 
    been good for a reason. We discussed the registrations with Dr. Hamilton, 
    Jessica and Sheila. A few of them were cancelled right away, especially the 
    ones of that evening in the Now &amp; Wow. So no William with his laughing gas. 
    I will write those people a thank-you-letter for their interest very soon. 
    Then there are at least twenty registrations in which we cannot decide yet. 
    This afternoon Sheila will give them a call inviting them for an interview. 
    Six people I agreed upon from the start due to my descriptions and also the 
    others. It’s up to me to call them this afternoon to set a date. Dr. 
    Hamilton was satisfied and made me compliments for the results I have made.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">So far my service 
    package concerning the registrations of new test subjects. The assistance of 
    test subjects is obviously also part of my job. During my stay in Holland 
    three new test subjects have been submitted. Not that many. Today we were 
    quite busy in the left wing of the building. Four test subjects needed an 
    implant and from five subjects the implant will be removed. All were 
    MSI-subjects except one of them.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">That 
    lucky one is Adelle. She seemed to be very happy lying in her hospital bed 
    when she told me that she would obtain a MESI. She really hoped so. <i>“Soon 
    you’ll be able to know how it is to be me!”</i> she forecasted with a 
    smiling face. <i>“I cannot wait until then just like you!”</i> I replied to 
    her. And I really meant it. After my stay in Holland during two weeks my 
    irritations for Adelle were gone. I like having her around me again. She is 
    a very strange person but in a pleasant way. I just had to get used to the 
    idea. I told her so and she started laughing. <i>“Many people have the same 
    problem.”</i> she admitted. <i>“But you know what I thought of you when I 
    first met you?”</i> Adelle made me curious. <i>“I thought: what sort of 
    smart mouse is walking around being such a misery. Must be somebody again 
    trying to find somebody’s help in order to complete herself while she is 
    already perfect.”</i> &nbsp;What did she mean by that? I did not get a chance to 
    ask her for an explanation ‘coss she got a visitor. Her niece lives close to 
    Seattle and came by with her young daughter. Adelle could communicate very 
    well with that kid. </span></p>
