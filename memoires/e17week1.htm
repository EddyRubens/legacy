    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I cannot help looking 
    at this huge bouquet which I got for Valentine every now and again. I have 
    already read this poem more than a hundred times. Who could it be? It is a 
    beautiful poem although I do not like poems very much. Somebody who cannot 
    sleep at night and thinks of me. Mmmmh. But who? I still hope it’s Kodjiro. 
    Would he be able to write such a poem? ‘Coss Japanese rather prefer to write 
    an haiku. In this poem also comparisons with nature can be read, so who 
    knows…I think it must be a romantic person anyway. And a shy type of person 
    who is afraid of talking. Dammit, why all of this should be so thrilling?

    Sonja really likes this tension. Together we wrote down all people we know 
    through Braintec on a list. <i>“Anybody who is here shorter than two weeks 
    is off the list.”</i> she decided and crossed out a few names. <i>“Why?”</i> 
    I asked. <i>“It can be love at first sight?”</i> Sonja did not share my 
    naive vision and called the concept a mythical invention. <i>“In this poem 
    you can clearly read that the writer has experienced your memories.”</i> She 
    declared. If we conclude on this, many persons will be left out. For 
    instance Dr. Tachikawa. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“Steward!”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    Sonja screamed suddenly. <i>“I think it is Mark Steward!”</i> We could not 
    stop laughing. He is the last person I would think of to give me flowers. 
    And Sonja knew it. I got frightened by the idea of getting to know him 
    better. But I have to admit that he had been looking at me already a few 
    times. And as far as we know he is not married. It would explain the 
    complicated relation between him and Dr. Tachikawa. <i>“No, Sonja,”</i> I 
    said when my last convulsion of laughter stopped. <i>“I don’t want to think 
    of that, out of the question. Cross out!”</i> </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After some more 
    speculations we came to the conclusion than there was no other way out than 
    hunting for handwritings. Actually the poem had been written by hand. It is 
    most likely that the sender would be found through this way. But how could 
    we manage to collect samples of handwritings from the people mentioned on 
    our list? Everything here is automated in every detail. We decided to 
    investigate all files secretly. You never know if we could find some 
    handwritten notes in them. But no, apart from a few they would all refer to 
    Jessica’s and Sheila’s. Then Sonja came up with a splendid idea. <i>“We will 
    buy a card for Robbert who tends to be in a depression and will ask 
    everybody to write something on it!”</i> Smart girl. Everybody knows Robbert 
    is divorcing his wife. Very convincing!</span></p>
