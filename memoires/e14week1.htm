    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Looking for suitable 
    locations took me a lot of time. Oh my! Those presentations are giving me a 
    hard time organizing. Except for the construction, transportation and taking 
    care of the materials. Making telephone-calls all day. Felt like a callgirl. 
    But I succeeded. I managed to organize five presentations with a 
    business-stand, like the one yesterday at the university, and two 
    presentations representing a lecture. Dr. Hamilton will be satisfied. I 
    especially searched for universities, cultural institutions and other 
    locations where students usually appear. In realizing that I often made 
    profit of the network which I have gained from art. Tonight I have my next 
    presentation. Actually at midnight for I start at twelve o’clock sharp. They 
    offered me this corner at the Now &amp; Wow, a party centre in Rotterdam. There 
    I will definitely approach many students and other young people.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">The 
    audience was absolutely astonishing. How young and naïve they were! Their 
    responsibility did not go as far as ordering their next drink. If it was not 
    for the fact that I represent a reliable company such as Braintec, but for a 
    secret organization buying organs of living people, they’d probably checked 
    in just as easy. How much for their liver? I reached to twenty-three 
    registrations but I have this feeling that more than half of them will drop 
    out. Obviously that part will not realize tomorrow that they really 
    registered themselves. Many people were drunk or were influenced by 
    something else. It really got into a big mess. A fair and I was the latest 
    attraction. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">One boy clearly beat 
    the lot. If I try hard I can just read that his name is William. He was not 
    able to write properly and messed-up at least six registration-forms. I 
    suggested we subscribed together. <i>“No, I want to do it on my own!”</i> he 
    made clear. He looked at me and I got scared of his eyes. I couldn’t see his 
    iris. It was impossible to judge whether he had blue or brown eyes. <i>
    “Okay,”</i> I said to the black saucers and gave him form number seven. He 
    was wearing a plastic horn on his belt. <i>”It really is a fair out here!”</i> 
    I shouted and pointed at the yellow toy. My throat was starting to hurt me. 
    I wasn’t easy to be understood. Very concentrated but yet very 
    uncontrollable William tried to reach for the horn. It took some time before 
    he understood that he should put down his pen first. <i>“That’s laughing 
    gas!”</i> he said as it was a conspiracy. He managed to grab it and showed 
    it to me passionately. Asked me whether I wanted too. <i>“No, thanks, anyway. 
    I don’t think it will improve my health, and definitely not my locomotion!”</i> 
    He seemed to be somewhat disappointed. <i>“But it will be when you want your 
    dreams come true!”</i> he answered and pointed at the text of one of the 
    flags: <i><b>Braintec makes your dreams come true.</b></i></span></p>
