    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Last night I had such a 
    strange dream. I dreamt there were young hamsters everywhere, my hamsters. A 
    while ago I had been somewhat irresponsible and had caused way too many 
    hamsters to be born. I needed to find care takers for these animals. But I 
    had no time and forgotten them. Now I had lost them. I knew there were many 
    and that they needed to eat. But I couldn’t find them anywhere. I searched 
    the entire Braintec building. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">Even an old dusty attic that Braintec 
    definately doesn’t have. Some employees asked me what I was looking for but 
    I didn’t want to tell them. I was ashamed of causing so many hamsters to be 
    born and now I had even lost them. So might already be dead, because I 
    hadn’t fed them for a long time. Before I found even one hamster I woke up. </span>
    <span lang="NL-BE" style="font-family: Arial">Wide awake. </span>
    <span style="font-family:Arial">I was all sweaty, and the sheets were all sticky 
    because of it. For a long time I sat upright in bed. What an odd dream. I 
    couldn’t get it out of my head. Hamsters! What business do I have with 
    hamsters? I grabbed the rabbit and cuddled it until I calmed down a bit. 
    Still it took me another hour to fall back to sleep. </span></p>
