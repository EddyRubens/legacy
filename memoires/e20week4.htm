    <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-weight: 700">Kathy couldn’t be 
    stopped. She was ready for a new upload and suddenly became hysterical. She 
    shouted she didn’t want it any longer while pushing away almost everybody. 
    Steward gave her a shot. I wasn’t there at the time but he told me. He 
    thought I ought to know and asked me to stay with her when she woke up. It 
    was nasty to see how they had tied her down. They didn’t know where her 
    anger came from and perhaps it would return after the anesthesia.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">She had been sleeping for more than two 
    hours. I finished reading my magazine and I started feeling hungry. While 
    getting a sandwich, she woke up. She was sitting up straight and luckily she 
    didn’t need to be tied up again. She had called her dad. He should be here 
    within just a bit more than one hour. That seemed to be a good idea. Kathy 
    really looked so worried and I didn’t manage to comfort her. I sometimes 
    have the impression that she is afraid of me.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica"><b>Indeed mister Ferguson came later 
    that afternoon. He wanted to take Kathy with him right away and asked me 
    where to find her possessions. I took him to Dr. Hamilton. Steward was there 
    too and together they explained that it shouldn’t be wise to take Kathy home 
    for the time being. They couldn’t find the reason for her fear and on the 
    other hand she still has her implant. Leaving now would be very foolish. <i>
    “Why don’t you get out that thing!”</i> mister Ferguson shouted. He posed in 
    such a way that he was ready for fighting. Dr. Hamilton explained that Dr. 
    Tachikawa is not here at the moment and that he prefers to delay an eventual 
    operation simply for that reason. Steward promised that he would make a 
    brain-scan the same day, while he didn’t expect something was wrong with 
    Kathy physically. He trivialized the whole event. Mister Ferguson calmed 
    down a bit but looked at us insistently. <i>“If anything is wrong with my 
    Kathy, even if you touch just one hair. You are not finished with me!”</i> 
    Steward acknowledged and hushed up the man even a bit more. After that he 
    walked with us towards Kathy.</b>&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
    <span style="font-family:Helvetica">Obviously Kathy was very happy to see 
    her father. She seemed to be in much better condition than before. I 
    suggested that mister Ferguson would stay for dinner, but he refused my 
    offer. He returned to the rest of his family and promised to be back 
    tomorrow.</span></p>
