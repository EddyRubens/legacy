    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I find it bland that I 
    can’t have that failed memory again. Rosanne had the rollercoaster for 
    several times. I said that I wanted to see if the bird is still in it. But 
    to be honest i wanted to see the thing Adrian talks about. That i didn’t 
    mention of course. Adrian had no bird and i guess Rosanne didn’t have one 
    either. Rosanne spoke about feathered ladies so perhaps she saw a 
    combination of the two things. Then you finally think that you’re able to 
    look inside other people’s minds, you still know nothing. Everyone is 
    experiencing the memories differently. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">They behave mysterious 
    about the extra images. I wonder if they know how they came in? The images 
    are really there, that’s obvious. </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I had another memory. 
    It was nice though, some kind of air show. Adrian and Michael had it as well, 
    i guess. It was satisfying indeed and i liked it. But I secretly hoped to 
    have something extra’s again. I hadn’t. </span></p>
