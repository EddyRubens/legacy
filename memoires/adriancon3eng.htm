    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The up- 
    and downloads of memories became some kind of routine. I don’t feel much 
    during an upload. It is just making a copy. A small headache and after an 
    hour I’m back to normal. The memories I got downloaded have a bigger 
    influence on me. I have seen the simple images of objects by now, but the 
    complete experiences of stories, I don’t know how to call them, have 
    sometimes a huge impact on me.&nbsp; Sometimes they make me very cheerful, but 
    once in a while I don’t know how to deal with them. Sometimes I become 
    already afraid during the download when I notice it’s a story. They become 
    more and more complicated. Fortunately I can consult the psychologists, 
    because otherwise I would sometimes loose my mind. I feel trusted when I 
    tell them what the memories do to me. It relieves me when I talk about my 
    (?) memories. Although these memories aren’t my own, afterwards I experience 
    them as if they are. The memories become familiar. So I remember some of the 
    memories. It sounds strange, but I think that you know what I mean. They 
    seem to be mine! I shall try to explain what I mean by the memory I’ve got 
    downloaded last week: </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">I was 
    on a sailing boat with a couple of friends. We did a boat-delivery and 
    sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from the Azores towards Great Britain. 
    There wasn’t a breath of wind, dead calm. The Ocean’s water looked like a 
    mirror. The wind didn’t seem to be coming back and we became bored. We had 
    already been swimming, and I came up with the idea to inflate the rubber 
    boat and to go rowing. The current would keep me in the neighbourhood of the 
    sailing boat. After a couple of rounds around the boat I rowed a bit further 
    away. It was very warm. Hardly a cloud in sight. When I looked back at the 
    boat, the mothership, at the first time, it all looked peaceful. The big 
    sails hung down the mast as quiet white shapes. Still no breath of wind. I 
    rowed a bit further and lay down in the boat to turn on my back and enjoyed 
    the silence. I heard the soft murmurs of air bubbles around me. They came 
    above from the deep ocean and spattered against the rubber boat. Suddenly I 
    realized where I was and I turned around. I could only see the top of the 
    mast from the sailing boat at the horizon. I got scared, scared to death. I 
    suddenly thought: “There are four kilometers of water underneath me and 
    eight kilometers of air above me. And I am between those two elements!” I 
    felt like a little piece of dust, so small, so worthless between heaven and 
    earth. I thought about my girlfriend and my one and a half year old son and 
    I thought of my four friends in the sailing boat. I Had To Go Back! I don’t 
    want to stay here, all alone! I broke out in a cold sweat and I started to 
    row. Harder and harder, deep strokes in the ocean’s water, till I could see 
    more of the mothership. I was soaked with sweat. The sun, the heat and most 
    of all the fear. When I eventually got back on board, there was a cup of tea 
    waiting for me. I felt home again, but that feeling of insignificance I 
    shall never forget.</span></i></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Every 
    time I think back to this memory, I feel that fear again. And I wonder who 
    it was, who was so scared. Was it me, or the person who really experienced 
    this? Or the both of us. It is all very confusing for me. I don’t want this. 
    Maybe I’ll have to stay busy with developing and let them get this 
    @#$%!*&amp;-chip out of my temporary lobe……. </span>
