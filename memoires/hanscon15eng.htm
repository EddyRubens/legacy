    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Don’t join the fight, says Heather. 
    The information on your laptop seemed to be far too valuable. After sixty 
    seconds Heather carefully peeps behind the stone. Nothing to see. Where is 
    everyone? Well, then we can come out, I say. No, you don’t, answers Heather. 
    But it all seems to be safe, I continue. See how you look, you really can’t 
    show yourself this way. Only then I see I’m bleeding. Breaking free made to 
    much pressure to the pods at my skin. Out of every pod flow little streams 
    of blood. I look like one of the monsters shown at the temple walls. We try 
    to see it as a symbol to get rid of Braintec’s bad spirits. The bandage 
    Heather is carrying are just sufficient enough to cover all wounds. Heather 
    cleans the wounds first with the water of the holy spring. That shall 
    prevent me for infections, I say. With all we’ve done here we certainly 
    enter the Nirvana, Heather thinks. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Now I can be seen but still my 
    clothes can’t. The blood made some nasty spots. So we sacrifice my shirt to 
    the holy stone. There is a temple shop nearby where we saw some textile 
    hanging. We walk fast towards it. My naked chest isn’t that weird because 
    the Japanese drummers have that as well. Inside the textile collection is 
    very limited. It is a temple shop and they only have traditional Japanese 
    ceremony clothes. Heather loves it and searches for a richly decorated 
    bridegroom outfit. It suits you perfectly, she says. As I want to walk 
    outside again, Heater pulls at the huge collar of my suit. Look there, she 
    warns me. On top of a roof we see people with guns. They want to shoot us. 
    The information we carry with us must be very important.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">What to do next? First we wait. At 
    the shop is a restaurant and we eat a lovely Japanese honeymoon meal that 
    fits perfectly to my outfit. After this dinner the shutters are still 
    present. There is someone with a gun hidden on top of another building as 
    well. Isn’t that Paul? Isn’t he to be trusted either? It is better only to 
    trust ourselves. We need a new plan. Fortunately that comes easily. The long 
    honeymoon ceremony inside the temple has finished and the whole bunch of 
    people slowly heads for our direction. We won’t be seen if we join this 
    procession. I am already dressed for it. Now Heather needs some new cloths. 
    I make her happy with a beautiful wedding dress I saw before. As a real 
    bride and bridegroom we join the group at the moment they pass the shop. It 
    turns out to be three couples to be married at the same time. That makes 
    four including us. We are the most beautiful pair, we think. We have to act 
    Japanese not to be conspicuous. We can handle that. We feel rather home here. 
    Do we really have to leave Japan tomorrow? Outside the temple area are a lot 
    of cars waiting to transport the whole group. We hold a taxi that looks like 
    the wedding cars. </font></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial">The driver understands how he has to 
    join the group. The Japanese families don’t react at the fact we sneak into 
    their procession. During this trip we see a car driving by with the people 
    we saw with guns on the temple roof. Two minutes later another car drives by 
    with Paul in it. We don’t know what he wants from us, so try not to pull his 
    attention. The procession stops at a rich hotel. We ask the taxi driver to 
    wait. Inside the hotel are shops, happily. We buy clothes and attaché 
    suitcases where we store our wedding clothes. As hansom business people we 
    walk out again. The driver is surprised by our transformation but doesn’t 
    mention it.</span></p>
