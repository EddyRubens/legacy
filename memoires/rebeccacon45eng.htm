    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">When Megan started off 
    to tell her side of things, she began to tell me some of her family history. 
    She said she was half Irish, and half Russian. She said her mother, (Evelyn 
    Clíona O'Malley) was full blooded Irish which is where she obviously got her 
    hair color and eye color from, and her father, (Nikolai Dimitri Isakova) was 
    where she got her accent and Russian last name. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She had written down 
    their names and her full name (Megan Críosa Olesya Isakova) on a piece of 
    paper with the family's address in Russia. She said to please contact her 
    parents if anything were to happen to her. She seemed very nervous and 
    unsure of how she was going get out of the trouble she had gotten herself 
    into.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She mentioned that the 
    reason she wanted me to know about her family is because her father is a 
    retired agent of the KGB. She said she is not supposed to speak about his 
    past, but she accidentally slipped and told Dr. Tachikawa when she first 
    came here. She went on to say that all he ever asks her about is her father. 
    Megan said, <i>&quot;He wants to know all sorts of things about the work my 
    father use to do and the names of the people he use to work with.&quot; </i>She 
    continued, <i>&quot;I have had three extraction's, and in all of them, Dr. 
    Tachikawa took me back to my childhood. He kept trying to weed out any 
    information he could get about my father and his duties as an agent in the 
    KGB.&quot;</i> She explained that her father, Nikolai, never discussed his work 
    with the family. I guess it was too dangerous for them to know any 
    information. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I felt as though Megan 
    put her trust in me when she mentioned one incident that she overheard her 
    father telling her mother. She said he was talking about a supposed increase 
    in Black Widows in a particular area in Russia. She said her father 
    mentioned mishaps might have taken place at a former KGB compound, where 
    classified biological warfare experiments were conducted. That was the 
    specific line of work he dealt with. He use to work as a 'First Chief 
    Directorate.' (Foreign Operations) He specialized in the collection of 
    political, scientific, biological and technological intelligence and 
    geographic departments for different areas of the world. (Megan also wrote 
    that information down for me) He told her mother that the 'Black Widow 
    Breakout' might have been a biological project stemming from the one of the 
    Middle Eastern countries or Asia, used to 'discretely wipe out a specific 
    area of population.'&nbsp; Dr. Tachikawa found out about that memory during the 
    first of her extraction's. Since then, he has been trying to come up with 
    some sort of experiment to draw out other old memories. The hypnotizing has 
    not been successful for him. This is why they have been keeping her isolated. 
    Dr. Tachikawa is obviously after foreign information.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">She went on to tell me 
    that Dr. Hamilton was always really nice and respected that she didn't want 
    to discuss things. My stomach turned over when she said that. Not because he 
    repulses me, though I know he should, but because I knew she was right.&nbsp; I 
    just have the feeling that he came upon this whole idea to truly help people. 
    He just got involved with the wrong person as a partner. He is so 
    financially dependent on Dr. Tachikawa, that I think he is afraid he will 
    lose this entire Braintec project if he dares to say anything.</span></p>
