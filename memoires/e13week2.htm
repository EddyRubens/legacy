    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was a difficult 
    journey, with two changes. I arrived at Schiphol totally exhausted. I was 
    almost numbed with tiredness. The change-over in London was the worst. I had 
    to wait one and a half hour. It was the afternoon there but it actually felt 
    like very early morning. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">To my complete 
    surprise a large group of people were waiting for me at the Dutch airport. I 
    had called my parents that I would be coming and my mother suggested she’d 
    come and pick me up. I didn’t expect her to bring so many people. My dad, my 
    sisters and their partners, my friend Jeanine, Karin, auntie Connie and 
    uncle Joep. Just fabulous</span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">!
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial">I was dead tired but this warm 
    welcome brought me back to reality. Jeanine had brought a Dutch flag and as 
    we embraced she put it on me like a coat. Tears were running down my cheeks. 
    It was such an emotional reception. </span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Once back at my 
    parents’ house I soon had had enough of it though. It was nice to see 
    everyone again and I really appreciated their coming, but I was incredibly 
    tired. I just wanted to lie down. I hadn’t been able to get much sleep on 
    the plane. I had been much too exuberant. After watching three crap movies I 
    became tired enough to sleep, but then I needed to stay awake for the 
    change-over. Coming home I was so tired that nothing meant anything to me 
    anymore. And they were all going on about my health and to make things worse, 
    even more members of my family came by to say hello. My mum had started 
    organized a big welcoming party right after I called. Well meant of course 
    but not what I wanted at this point in time. Defeated by lack of sleep I 
    just sat staring into the distance. My ears ringing. Eventually I stopped 
    caring and just crawled into the bed in the guestroom. As far as I was 
    concerned they were welcome to party without me.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
