    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After I put away all 
    my things I was feeling a little better. Those butterflies finally went away. 
    It must have been the feeling of being in a new place, away from familiarity. 
    &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I am already missing 
    Bruce and Josh. When I napped on the plane I had a dream that Josh proposed 
    to me. I almost got right back on another plane to go home, but that would 
    have been a wasted trip here to Oregon. Besides, if went home, I would most 
    likely spend the rest of my life wondering about Braintec, the implants, and 
    the memory recalls. Nope, first things first. I am here and I will follow 
    through, then I will go home to my men.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I touched up my makeup 
    and put my hair in a ponytail. It has been an hour and a half since I 
    arrived and I am waiting for the tour. I wonder if I am supposed to go back 
    out to the room I was in earlier or if someone will come for me. I was 
    hoping to ask Carmen. She still has not returned. How much testing can you 
    do in one day? I'm sure they will come for me soon. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In the mean time I 
    might play solitaire on my laptop. There is a computer in here. It's small 
    and looks kinda old. I'm not sure if it belongs to Carmen or Braintec. Good 
    thing I have mine. I hate to depend on other people for things!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">This might sound 
    horrible, but sitting in this room all alone with nothing to do, kinda makes 
    me want to snoop. I have always been the kind of person who wants to know 
    everything about everything and everything about everyone! <i>When I was a 
    kid I must have said, &quot;Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why?, and How?&quot;</i> about 
    a million times! But I think I should be adult about it and let Carmen tell 
    me about herself when I finally get to meet her. I think I better just stick 
    to solitaire.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I hear voices in the 
    hall. It must be Rosanne and the rest of the group </span>

    tour. I will add another entry when I return.</span><span lang="NL" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"> </span>
