    temple. It was a highlight for tourists. A lot of souvenir shops and such. I 
    discovered Heather and Hans in the distance. </span><span lang="NL" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">A Japanese boy 
    approached them and they followed him. Through a lot of small streets they 
    finally reached a restaurant and went in. <i>“We go in, Adrian”</i> said 
    Rosanne. There was no other solution. We couldn’t just witness what would 
    happen. The place was completely empty. Nothing, nothing to see at all. 
    There was a door at the back. Behind that door we saw Heather and Hans, but 
    also a group of Japanese and Kodjiro. I yelled at Heather and Hand. <i>“Get 
    out of here. Run!”</i> Heather could get away but Hans was hold. I dived 
    upon his waylayer and he could escape as well. Now I was held. By three men. 
    There was no way to get free. I screamed and yelled and Rosanne jumped upon 
    us. I have never seen her so outrageous. She bit and she kicked. Slammed and 
    scratched and hammered at the men. It helped. Suddenly I felt some space and 
    I could get away. I started to run. Outside. The last thing I saw when I 
    looked at the door, was Kodjiro holding Rosanne. He looked at her concerning. 
    Gave me the eye and winked. That was enough. Running, those fellows won’t 
    let me go that easily. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I had to continue 
    running. They were right behind me. I jumped over a hedge and landed in a 
    garden. Straight through, across the lawn and then straight through the 
    bushes. Next hedge, over it again. At the street. There a cabdriver was 
    cleaning his windscreen. I pushed him in the car and gave him the address of 
    the latest hotel Rosanne and I stayed, before we went to Kodjiro. The driver 
    understood my hurry and we hared off. For now I was safe and I could get 
    some breath.</span></p>
