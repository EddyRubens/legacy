    Sonja’s meeting left its mark on me. Because I don’t know whom I should 
    trust and whom I don’t, I called Adrian. I can always trust him. Luckily I 
    still had his mobile number with me. Meanwhile I was afraid it was in the 
    middle of the night in Portland. He sounded a bit sleepy. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It was great to hear 
    his voice. I told him all I knew. About Jessica, about the strange 
    extraction and the way he tried to strangle me and that that’s my reason for 
    not knowing whether I should trust Kodjiro any longer. About that strange 
    meeting and about Hans and Heather. And of course also about Sonja. Adrian 
    was listening attentively. He also finds it hard to take part in it. Then it 
    was his turn. He told me that he had dinner with Dr. Hamilton. And that, 
    meanwhile, he possesses a great number of M-Stores. Part of them had been 
    sent to him by mail, together with an air-ticket to Tokyo</span><i><span style="font-family: Arial">. 
    “Did you also?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> I asked. <i>“Are 
    you coming over here? I would love to see you again.”</i> Silence on the 
    other end of the line. He didn’t make up his mind yet. I think he preferred 
    that I would return to Portland. But I really don’t fancy that at all.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="font-family: Arial">“What do you think 
    I should do, Adrian?”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> I really 
    sounded desperate. Am I really in need that much?&nbsp; <i>“Usually I ask myself 
    that question a couple of times a day,”</i> he answered. <i>“I really don’t 
    know. Maybe I want to return to </i></span><i>
    <span style="font-family: Arial">Elgin.”</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
    I absolutely didn’t fancy that option. At that moment Adrian seemed to be my 
    only link to reality, somebody who is not influenced by unexplained behavior 
    or through my suspicion. If he goes home now, we are on a sinking ship! <i>
    “No, you’d better come over here!”</i> I said. <i>“You didn’t get that 
    ticket for nothing?”</i> Adrian seemed to hesitate a lot. He couldn’t make 
    up his mind yet. We were talking about a few beautiful memories we had 
    experienced together and emphasized our relationship between brother and 
    sister. Then suddenly my phone-expenses expired. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
    Shall Adrian come to Tokyo as well? Or will he keep waiting in Portland 
    until I return? Now that Dr. Hamilton no longer threatens to remove my 
    implant, I think I might be safer over there. Then I shouldn’t be afraid for 
    that grumpy man Sonja was warning me about. That collection of M-Stores 
    Adrian was talking about, also made me curious. What could be on it? If I 
    return to Portland, I’ll probably never find out what’s the real situation 
    concerning Hans and Heather. Only if I stay here, I can mean something 
    important to them.</span></p>
