                  Braintec</i></b> has developed two kinds of implants. The 
    smallest implant, called MSI (Magnetic Stimulator Implant), is only 2 cm in 
    diameter and capable of sending memories from the server to the memory area. 
    The MESI (Magnetic Extractor Stimulator Implant) is also capable of 
    extracting the memories outside the brain and in sending them to the server 
    outside the body. <span lang="NL">This increased capacity is what makes the 
    MESI twice as long.</span></font></td>

    <td width="375"><font face="Times New Roman">The <b><i>Braintec</i></b>-implant 
    is a small device placed surgically into the temporal lobe. It contains 
    several microchips that make it possible for the brain to communicate with a 
    server outside the body. A stimulating substance in the outer layer of the 
    implant causes the surrounding nerve-cells to make connections. That is how 
    the implant gets connected in quite a unique manner with the nervous system 
    and how it uses only a miniscule amount of energy from the surrounding 
    cellular tissue. </font>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The server is placed 
      diagonally above the left ear. It is a round device that is technically 
      similar to a Transcranial Stimulator. Small plates can be placed inside 
      the server. These plates are called M-stores, they actually contain the 
      memories.
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Especially the brain 
      area around the amygdale and the hypothalamus are stimulated during the 
      re-experience of the memories. The neural network takes over these qualia 
      almost directly and activates the whole system to process the new arrived 
      information. Most of the test subjects find such a re-experience 
      surprisingly pleasant. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">The insertion of an 
      MESI-implant is a much more complicated operation than that of an MSI. 
      Tracing the exact location takes a lot of time and so does recovery. The 
      extraction of the memories is considerably more complex than the 
      re-experience of memories. A successful extraction can sometimes take up 
      to eight hours.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">At this moment there are 
      only three people with an MESI-implant. Only they are capable of 
      re-experiencing their own memories. Test subjects with an MSI-implant 
      experience memories that are not their own. How they perceive these 
      memories is depending on the perceptions they have gathered through time, 
      so every test subject has their own unique experience. The amount of test 
      subjects with an MSI-implant grows with the day.</font></p>
