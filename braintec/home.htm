<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Braintec</i></b> is a 
progressive technology company testing and developing the inventions of the Japanese genius 
K.Tachikawa. Professor Tachikawa has developed a method to make it possible to 
copy memories, take them out of the brain and store them as binary codes outside the body. 
These codes can be re-introduced at a later point in time and then used to 
stimulate the memory area of the brain, 
through which the concerning memory can be re-experienced. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Until now this procedure was 
only possible under surgical circumstances, through direct stimulation of the 
amygdale and the hypothalamus. <span lang="NL">The <b><i>Braintec</i></b>-team 
develloped an implant that sends the memories back and forth from exogenous devices like 
a service hatch. </span>Through this method the skull has to be opened only 
once, to place the implant, after which unlimited experimentation in exchanging 
memories becomes possible. The amount of side-effects has declined to such an 
extent that it is possible to perform extended research on the function and 
perception of memories. There have already been sensational discoveries that 
gave us new insights in several mental disorders. They will probably result in 
some new treatments. </font></p>
