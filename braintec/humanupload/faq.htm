	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
	<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>What is the Humanupload 
    Project? </i> <br>
	</b>The Humanupload Project is a project of the Braintec Institute, a 
	progressive technology company for research on memories. A humanupload is the transfer of the human 
	thought and memory from the scanned brain tissue to an automated facsimile.</font></p>
    

	<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Isn't it dangerous to create a humanupload? Won't the original mind be destroyed?</i></b><br>
	Some posthumanistic philosophers believe a humanupload will destroy 
	the original mind. This is a huge misconception. The definition of a humanupload Braintec is working on is just a huge range of MEMES (memories 
	and thoughts) with whatever details of the test subject’s life available but without the human mentality or a personal genetic makeup. Identity 
	remains unique and inviolate. Therefore it is not dangerous.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>What is the side effect of a humanupload for the test 
	subject?</i></b><br>
	We can state that in other research, a test subject might lose a thousand 
	neurons from drug use and obviously remain the same person though the 
	pattern of neurons has changed.&nbsp; Actually, patterns that can be derived from 
	our organic states shift constantly without effecting identity. We all 
	change over the course of time, yet remain ourselves. The creation of a humanupload won't be different from that. The effect may not even be 
	noticeable.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" font><br>
	Beside that, a backup of your memories and thoughts will be very valuable in 
	cases of trauma, mental illness, brain diseases, memory loss or other misfortune.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font></font></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
				<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>How can Braintec create a humanupload?</i></b><br>
				We have developed a prototype of an innovative bi-directional 
				electroencephalogram (brainwave) machine that enables a 
				computer to read and induce the human’s brainwaves.
              </font> </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">
	<font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Why do you want to astablish a 
    humanupload for?<br>
	</i></b>Like most medical research 
	programs, we work for the sake of science. Our technology is already having a significant impact on bio-medical study. Many fields, including drug 
	discovery and toxicological research, will certainly benefit from the creation of Braintec's first humanupload.
Conservation of this instantaneous exposure might come in hand for 
	new kinds of therapy as well.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
	<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>How can I 
				help your research?</i></b><br>
				If you join the BraintecGrid, your donation of spare 
              computer cycles helps us to unravel the enormous amount of MEMES, 
              to analyze this data and makes it possible to comprehend the first humanupload.</font></p>

				<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
				<font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>What 
				is the BraintecGrid?<br>
				</i></b>The BraintecGrid is a global grid that connects 
				thousands of volunteers’ personal computers. The BraintecGrid saves and distributes 
				the otherwise wasted power of these computers for our valuable scientific and 
				medical research without disturbing the usual computer use of 
				the volunteers.</font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">
				<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>
				Why did you build the BraintecGrid?</i></b><br>
				We require more 
              computational power than is available in the largest existing 
              supercomputer. With the BraintecGrid, we use thousands of small 
				computers, all working simultaneously on different parts of the 
				analysis. With this attempt to use large-scale distributed computing 
				power we will 
              analyze the most sensitive scans ever done.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>My personal computer has only 
	very little computing power compared to a supercomputer. How can it be at 
	any help?</i></b><br>
	It can certainly be helpful!
	We break up the large datasets 
              into small chunks that are essentially independent of one 
              another. In 
              this way, we can distribute the work to people willing to donate 
              their spare CPU cycles. Even your personal computer can analyze these chunks or 
	work-units&nbsp;comparatively quickly, no matter how slow or how fast it is. </font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Why 
				should I join the BraintecGrid?</i></b><br>
				A great amount of computer 
              power is necessary to comprehend the first humanupload. Without 
				the help of thousands 
				of volunteers’ personal computers worldwide we would never get the job done, which is 
    why we need you (and your friends!) to become part of the BraintecGrid. If 
				you join the BraintecGrid, you can start making a difference. </font></p>

	the Humanupload Program</b></span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>What is the Humanupload 
	Program?<br>
	</b></i>The Humanupload Program is a small program that works as 
              a special kind of screensaver. We invite you to download this 
				free software and become part of the BraintecGrid. </font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">
				<font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>How does the Humanupload 
	Program works?</i><br>
	</b> Like other screensavers it starts 
              up when you leave your computer unattended, and it shuts down as 
              soon as you return to work. What it does in the interim is unique. 
              While you are getting coffee, having lunch or are asleep, your 
              computer helps unravelling the memories and 
              thoughts of our testsubjects. The 
				Humanupload Program automatically downloads small pieces 
    of data from our main server and performs calculations that analyze. After your computer 
    processed the information, the results are sent back to the Braintec 
    Institute.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>What do I see when the Humanupload 
	Program is running?</i> <br>
    </b>The screensaver shows several pie charts and graphics showing the 
	progress and history of the analyzed chunks. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>How long does it takes to analyze 
    a chunk of data?</b></i><br>
	Depending on the individual work 
    unit's parameters, this processing loop requires 2.4 to 3.8 trillion 
    floating-point operations (Tflop). It takes a typical (500 MHz) home 
    computer 10 to 12 hours to complete a work unit.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>What computers can run the 
    Humanupload Program?</i> </b><br>
    Currently, any Internet-connected Windows PC with a Pentium 133 or faster 
	processor, and 64MB of RAM or more, and Internet 
    Explorer 5 or higher installed. As we embark on Phase II, we will be adding other 
    popular platforms like Mac OS X and Linux.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Will I need to do anything 
    after I download and install the free software? </b></i><br>
	One of the beautiful 
    things about the free desktop application is that it will run on its own.
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Will the Humanupload Program interfere with my normal work?</i> </b>
	<br>
	No, it will not. As soon as you start using your computer again, the 
	Humanupload Program shuts down. You won't even notice 
    it's there waiting to solve one of the world's most complex problems. </font>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Will I lose control of my 
    dial-up? </b></i><br>
	You will never lose control of your dial-up or network 
    connection or any other part of your system. </font></p>
    			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Do I need to leave my computer 
    on all the time to run the Humanupload Program? </b></i><br>
	You are not required to 
    leave your computer on. However, the more time your computer is running, the 
    more time it spends working on the humanupload.</font></p>
    			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>How do I set my default screen saver?</b></i><br>
	In the Control Panel, double 
    click Display to bring up the Display Properties dialog.&nbsp;Select the Screen 
    Saver tab. There you will see a list of available screensavers from which to select. </font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><i><b>
				<font size="2">How do I completely get rid of 
    Humanupload Program?</font></b></i><font size="2"><br>
				You 
				can deactivate the &quot;BraintecGrid&quot; screensaver in the Control 
				Panel &quot;Display&quot; applet. And you can completely remove the program 
				by deleting the &quot;BraintecGrid.scr&quot; file in the Windows

				      No, you don't. Communications between clients and the

              chose this protocol because many Internet volunteers might be 
              behind firewalls that prohibit most traffic but permit access to
