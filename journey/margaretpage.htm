<H1><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Margaret Bradshaw Suspended</font><font face="Arial" size="3"><BR></font><font face="Arial" size="2">by Jim Yount</font></b></H1>
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>In the early morning hours of January 9, 1995, we received a call informing 
us that long-time cryonics activist and ACS Governor Margaret Bradshaw had 
committed suicide by shooting herself in the chest. Primarily because of the 
persuasion of Dr. Steve Harris, we were allowed to pack Margaret's head in ice 
shortly after the police completed their investigation and the body was brought 
into the county morgue. The body was autopsied at about 9:30 a.m., with 
cooperation by the county medical examiners to the extent of (1) excluding the 
head from the procedure, (2) doing this examination as the first such procedure 
of the day, (3) allowing us to pack the entire body in ice upon completion of 
the examination. She was then flown from San Francisco to southern California 
for perfusion and completion of the suspension which included neuro conversion. 
Long-term cryogenic storage will be at CryoSpan in southern California.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>When any cryonicist becomes a "coroner's case" there are, of necessity, many 
compromises in the quality of suspension. Given these severe restrictions, 
Margaret's suspension went fairly well. The county medical examiner cooperated 
about as much as we can reasonably expect in this day and age where cryonic 
suspension is not considered medical practice. More than any other factor, Dr. 
Harris' telephone discussions with the medical examiners help to establish 
credibility and cooperation. Our cooperating morticians were also of 
considerable help in taking over the responsibility for transport which freed us 
to concentrate on other aspects of the suspension.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Margaret's family and friends were most supportive. Because Margaret had been 
so open concerning her cryonics involvement, everyone close to her knew she was 
a cryonicist and honored Margaret's wishes even though some of them were 
personally skeptical.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The BioPreservation team did an excellent job, especially considering the 
difficult circumstances. They were set up and ready to proceed as soon as the 
patient was presented to them. Since I don't know what confidentiality 
restrictions may apply to the Biopreservation operation, I won't identify team 
members.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The Northern California Emergency Response team consisted of Sandra Russell, 
Naomi Reynolds, Edgar Swank, and myself. Sandra Russell's mobile phone proved 
especially helpful. We were able to keep closely in touch with Mike Darwin and 
the other Biopreservation team members whenever we felt consultation was 
necessary.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Introduced to cryonics through her friendship with Jerry White. It was 
Margaret who served as Jerry's primary care giver during Jerry's long bout with 
AIDS. Many aspects of Jerry's suspension were the best we have ever had. This 
success was in large measure due to Margaret's diligence and dedication.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Even when life seemed darkest and some psychological forces we don't 
understand compelled Margaret to take her own life, there must have been a part 
of her which still saw hope. When her life ended at age 50, she spared her 
brain, the usual target for gunshot suicides. Giving up on life in the 20th 
century was not necessarily saying good-by for good.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>At Margaret's memorial service on Sunday, January 15, at Oak Park's Chapel of 
Roses in San Jose, friends and family were invited to share memories of 
Margaret. We cryonicists spoke of Margaret's contribution to our movement. We 
knew her as a dedicated, industrious worker for the cause.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Cryonics was very much a "hands on" experience for Margaret. Besides her 
administrative cryonics work, she was a suspension team member on several 
experiments and assisted in mixing and other preparation of perfusate. Her 
background in biology made her a great asset to us during suspensions. Margaret 
was never shy about her cryonics involvement. Besides interesting her friends 
and family, she was a guest on the Sally Jesse Raphael's cryonics topic show. 
Dr. Dick Marsh and Dr. Avi Ben-Abraham also were guests.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>She was a suspension member since 1985, an ACS Governor since 1990, and our 
Treasurer for the past two years. Prior to 1990 she served as a Trans Time 
Director and as Board Secretary.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>At Margaret's memorial service, many of Margaret's colleagues from her work 
with Sterling Software attended, and several told work related antecdotes. 
Sterling Software is a contractor to NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, 
CA. Margaret had worked for Sterling since 1988.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Much of Sterling's work, including Margaret's job assignment, was done "on 
base," that is, right at Ames. Margaret was a Project Manager, most currently 
with the Graphics Development Project. In that capacity she managed the 
contractor group at Ames which was responsible for supporting advanced graphic 
hardware for the computer systems and research division of the Ames scientific 
community. Her work included system administration, site planning, trouble 
shooting, and network administration. Her boss summed up Margaret's job as 
"riding herd on an extremely talented group of individuals." And to "ride herd" 
Margaret had to understand the task and the tools extremely well.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>She co-authored a paper entitled On the Theory and Application of 
Stereographics in Scientific Visualization which was presented at the 1991 
Eurographics Convention. She also is a co-author of the book From Computer 
Graphics to Advanced Visual Communication, in which she wrote the chapter on 
"Stereographics."</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Prior to her work for Sterling, Margaret was a Software Engineer for Applied 
Materials, Inc. in Santa Clara where she wrote programs for process control of 
semiconductor processing equipment.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>She graduated from tne University of California at Santa Cruz with a B.A. in 
Computer and Information Science in June of 1986. She also attended Contra Costa 
College in San Pablo, Califoria, U.C. Berkeley, and U.C. Hayward majoring in 
Biology. We have a newspaper clipping of an article published in 1967 picturing 
Margaret and entitled: College Student Makes Analytical Biology Study. The 
article reports that Margaret, while a second year Biology major at Contra Costa 
College, researched the "Serum Analysis of Dietary Deficiencies by Disc 
Electrophoresis."</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>One of Margaret's high school friends spoke briefly at the Memorial, and told 
of when they attended Anna Head High School in Oakland. Margaret graduated in 
1962 and was known to the her fellow students as "Midge."</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Margaret's brother Stan, who is now a lawyer in Helena Montana, told us of 
going on camping and river rafting trips with Margaret. Stan said that he just 
got to know Margaret well in the past five years, but when he did get to know 
her he found he liked her very much.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>After Margaret's death, her old and dear friend Nancy Witstine discovered a 
couple of poems Margaret had written (which we include). Margaret had never 
mentioned her writing, but had told us of her admiration for Jerry White's 
poetry.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Like many of her fellow cryonicists, Margaret was an intelligent, highly 
accomplished person. Unlike some of us, she was also modest and private. Just 
this past year, Margaret took up flying and frequently talked about the thrill 
of guiding her own plane through the clouds.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The same adventurous spirit which prompted her to learn to fly at age 49, ten 
years earlier led her to enroll as a suspension member of the American Cryonics 
Society. The controls are in our hands now, Margaret, and we'll do what we can 
to ensure a safe landing for you and our other passengers.</b></font>
