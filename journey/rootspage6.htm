      directions. There is only one way to go for me, he told me, and that is
      directly back to where I came from. When he heard that I<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">’</span>m originally from
      the Netherlands, he started shouting at me. In his view my family had
      killed more Inuit then his family had killed foxes for those Dutch
      murderers. I tried to calm him down, because there where so many
      bystanders looking at us. His eyes where red and whirled, he had an awful smell of alcohol
      hung around him. I told him I thought
      the alcohol did him more harm then the Dutch people can nowadays. Thanks
      to the good spirits there were bystanders, because he almost killed me!</font></b>
      <p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="3">Perhaps it was the Dutch
      traders who brought the alcohol to Sisimiut, but you can<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">’</span>t blame me for
      that! The alcohol caused a lot of trouble and it still does, but that<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">’</span>s
      not my fault! Those Dutch ancestors where here in the 17th century, that<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">’</span>s
      about 400 years ago! A bit more then 50 years ago some German people did my
      family a lot of harm but I don<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">’</span>t blame their children!</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="3">It must be one of those
      differences in the mentality and I have to accept this man's behavior.
      But it hurts, in a strange kind of way. The accusing isn<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">’</span>t nice of course,
      but that is not what hurts the most. It is the demolition of this man that
      keeps burning on my retina. This demolition (perhaps the demolition of the
      whole Inuit culture) caused by alcohol and Western interfering.
      Civilization we call it. I can<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">’</span>t shrug my shoulders and say

This old, interesting and oh so
      beautiful culture is too valuable to let it be destroyed. I am glad the
      anti-alcohol organizations are growing with the day. The Inuit have
      survived so much adversity and disasters trough the ages, perhaps this is
      just another one.<a href="rootspage4.htm" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/backhoekje.gif" align="right" width="39" height="31"></a> </font></b></td>
