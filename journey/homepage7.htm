      better. He is a bit weird, but okay. Sometimes he can react the total
      opposite of what I would suspect him to do. For example: Yesterday he
      prepared a tasty diner. It was very romantic, with candlelight and such.
      We were flirting and giggling like teenagers and became quit close. I
      expected this to be our first time to end up in bed, but when I came back
      from bringing the dishes to the kitchen he was gone! This morning I found
      him. He was lying beside the snow, sleeping out his drunkenness. He could
      have been frozen to death!</b></font></p>
