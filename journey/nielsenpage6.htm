      Stiggie, Stig, Stig… </span>Hmm, no
      doubt I’m in love. It’s not his nose, his hair or his skin. Not even
      his eyes make me shiver. Perhaps it’s just his attention, his sweetness.
      He is so kind to me. A bit concerned perhaps. Stig is here in Greenland to
      do research about Tardigrada, some kind of protozoa. Those little species
      deposit their liquids and freeze during wintertime. In spring they extract
      water again and continue their life. This way they sustain temperatures
      below –270°C. I think Stig does the same to me. He makes me feel
      emotions I haven’t felt for years. </span>I
      almost forgot I could feel like this, as if every cell in my body is
      filled with liquid again.<o:p>

      still I don’t know if I should stay at his place when we arrive at

      have been acting very affected lately, so I must make an easy prey. Would
      that be a shame? Wouldn’t I love to be eaten alive? My thoughts are
      recoiling in the same rhythm as the waves. They even make my stomach
      squeeze together.<a href="nielsenpage2.htm" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/backhoekje.gif" align="right" width="39" height="31"></a></b></font></span></p>
