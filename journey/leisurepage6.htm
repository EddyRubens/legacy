      to go anyway <a href="stayorgo.htm" target="_top">(see all the reactions
      here)</a>, which gave me the courage to leave right away. I didn’t dare
      to stay another day. What a hell when you don’t know what to decide! I
      just wanted to go on with my life, it didn’t matter that I had to burn
      all my ships behind me. So I stuck to my original plan: to go to the
      North. I took the Dash 7 -a small airplane- to Kangerlussuaq and from
      there on I started hiking.</b></font></p>
