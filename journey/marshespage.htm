<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Dick March Suspended</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>On Friday, May 6, 1994, long-time ACS Governor, Dr. Richard P. (Dick) 
Marsh was pronounced legally dead and was suspended. Dick had been in poor 
health for many months with complications from a heart attack and respiratory 
problems. Dick was 81 years old.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Dick served on the ACS Board from February 22, 1981 until his suspension. He 
was the Editor of American Cryonics, the journal of the American Cryonics 
Society from 1987 through 1989 and also published in other cryonics magazines 
including The Immortalist.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Dick was always ready to lend a hand on cryonics projects. He assisted in 
quite a number of suspensions as a "gofer," and did editing and proof-reading 
for us for many of our documents, letters, and publications.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Dick was a full Professor at San Francisco State College in the department of 
Communications where he taught for over 30 years. He taught classes both in 
communications and in Radio and Television.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>For ten years just prior to his joining the faculty at San Francisco State he 
taught at San Mateo Community College in San Mateo.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>After graduating from San Francisco State, Dick went on to Cal Berkeley where 
he received his Masters Degree in the mid-1940's. During the WW II, Dick served 
in the Signal Corp as a civilian volunteer. Dick received his Ph.D. in Oriental 
Studies from the College of the Pacific. He spent time studying in India as part 
of his Ph.D. program.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>When classical radio station KKHI first went on the air in the mid-1940's, 
Dick's voice was the first voice heard by listeners. Dick continued at the 
station for several years. Dick was one of the people who started KCSM in San 
Mateo, California.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>In the late 1950's Public Television station KQED, Channel 9, in San 
Francisco featured a show hosted by Dick called Time for Nine. Along with Art 
Hough, Dick produced and was featured as on the air personality of sixty-five 
shows which aired on KPIX channel 5 in the 1970's.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Dick put his broadcast communications skills to good use for cryonics. He was 
always ready and willing to do interviews which included appearances on the Phil 
Donahue Show, and the Sally Jessy Raphael Show.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Along with his wife Lynne, Dick had a long-standing interest in physical 
conditioning. He studied and practiced Yoga and did weight training. Both Dick 
and Lynne were members of the Golden Gate Race Walkers as well as the San 
Francisco Race Walkers. Dick was also a runner and participated in many runs. 
Each year he ran the famous Bay to Breakers, he also once participated in the <a href="http://pweb.jps.net/~cryonics/ctopia.htm" target="_blank">Pikes Peak Marathon</a> and wrote of his experience in The Immortalist.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Dick was born in Lincoln Nebraska where he lived until his family moved to 
San Francisco when Dick was eight or nine years old. Dick loved San Francisco 
and spent most of his life there.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>He married Margaret McCaskill in 1949. They divorced a few years later. 
Margaret is now deceased. Dick has a stepdaughter, Jane Devine and a stepson, 
Peter Johnson.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>He married Lynne Reed in 1963. Lynne was a high school teacher who taught 
Home Economics at George Washington high school in San Francisco. Lynne was 
pronounced dead on August 25, 1992 and is now in suspension at the facility of 
the Cryonics Institute in Detroit.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>In mid-1993 with a decline in health, Dick moved to a retirement community in 
Walnut Creek near where his brother Earl Marsh, M.D., and sister-in-law Mickey 
Marsh, Ph.D., live. Following a hospitalization in January, 1994 Dick was moved 
to Roosemore Manner Convalescent Hospital where he stayed until his suspension.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Dick was suspended by BioPreservation which is under contract to the American 
Cryonics Society. This was the second suspension of ACS patients by 
BioPreservation, the first being the suspension of Jerry White on February 5, 
1994.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Although we were well aware that Dick was in poor health and might need 
cryonics services soon, his condition appeared to be improving. He was scheduled 
to start physical therapy the day he was pronounced dead. We were called only 
about fifteen minutes prior to that time and did not have a team and equipment 
at his bedside to start the suspension procedure.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Fortunately Dick's brother and sister-in-law, with help from a duty nurse, 
started CPR and packed him in ice. CPR was continued until about fifteen minutes 
before he was flown to Southern California by air ambulance. At the 
BioPreservation facility he was washed out, perfused, cooled down to -79 degrees 
C. (dry ice temperature) and then flown to the Cryonics Institute where he was 
cooled down to -196 degrees C. (liquid nitrogen temperature).</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Mike Darwin of BioPreservation reported that they were able to achieve good 
washout and to attain a high level of cryoprotective perfusion. Dick's 
step-daughter held a small memorial service for a few friends and family members 
on June 26, in Cupertino.</b></font><P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Richard wrote many articles and gave many talks about cryonics. One example 
is <a href="http://pweb.jps.net/~cryonics/ctopia.htm" target="_blank"><I>Communitopia</I></a></b></font>
