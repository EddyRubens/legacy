<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Jerry White Suspended</b></font>
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>On February 5, long-time cryonicist Jerry White, age 55, was pronounced dead 
and was suspended. Jerry (Jerome B.) had been ill for many months with 
complications from the AIDS virus.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Jerry is one of the founders of the American Cryonics Society (ACS) and 
served in various capacities as an officer and Governor, or committee member for 
most of our history.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>From 1968 through 1982 and from 1990 through 1992 Jerry served on our Board 
of Governors. He was society President from 1971 through 1982 succeeding Dr. M. 
Coleman Harris under which Jerry served as Vice-President. During his tenure as 
President he undertook many tasks on our behalf including the arduous chore of 
obtaining our non-profit tax exemption. He was frequently a guest on television 
and radio talk shows promoting cryonics as well as speaking to college and high 
school students and to clubs such as the Rotary club and Mensa (Jerry was a 
Mensa member).</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Jerry was also one of the founders of Trans Time, Inc. and served on the 
Trans Time Board for many years.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>He received a B.A. degree in Philosophy in 1966 from the University of New 
Mexico, Albuquerque, NM. He continued his education at the University of 
California at Berkeley where he studied Computer Science and Education. Jerry 
was especially interested in the Psychology of Learning, programmed learning, 
and computer-aided learning.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>From 1983 through 1992 Jerry was a lead designer for Sterling Federal 
Systems, Inc., of Palo Alto, California (Sterling Software). Sterling is a 
contractor to NASA Ames. While at Sterling Jerry worked on a variety of NASA 
projects including helping develop a computer program to analyze the atmosphere 
of Mars and on a variety of programs connected with the design of tilt-wing 
aircraft.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>He also worked for the University of California, College of Natural 
Resources; Honeywell Information Systems in San Francisco; the University of New 
Mexico, Albuquerque; and the General Programmed Teaching Corporation.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>From August 1957 through August 1959 Jerry was in the Navy where he served in 
the combat-information center as watch-section supervisor (radar) and as 
master-at-arms. He was honorably discharged with Captain's commendation.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Like many other cryonicists Jerry had a wide range of interests. He was a 
Lincoln scholar and collected over 500 books on President Lincoln. (This 
collection has been given to ACS.) He taught himself to read and speak Russian 
in elementary school. In addition to Russian, Jerry spoke and/or read German, 
Spanish, French, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Yiddish, and Modern Mongolian. He was a 
student of comparative languages and language origins.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Jerry was an active member of the Libertarian party and a staunch advocate of 
personal freedom. He was also active in the Gay-rights movement and AIDS causes. 
He did a number of newspaper interviews wherein he discussed his disease and his 
cryonic suspension arrangements.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Here are some of his papers and conference presentations which cryonicists 
will find of interest:</b></font>

<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Jerry's suspension is the first ACS suspension by BioPreservation, a southern 
California firm headed by Mike Darwin and Dr. Steve Harris. Some of our people 
who trained under Mike using the suspension protocol developed by Mike, Jerry 
Leaf, and others, participated in the standby and suspension. This was also our 
first use of the emergency response equipment which we purchased from 
BioPreservation in 1993.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>The months of preparation and training helped to give Jerry a first-class 
send-off. Cardiopulmonary support was started immediately. The treating 
physician was quickly on the scene to pronounce and assist. Total-body washout 
was initiated within an hour and a half of pronouncement. The detailed 
preparation by ACS and BioPreservation, the dedication of our advising 
physician, and the professionalism of our contract mortuary (within a few miles 
of Jerry's home) all contributed to success. It is the opinion of Mike and 
others that this suspension compares favorably to the best suspensions done to 
date. Unlike so many other suspensions there were no significant complications 
or unforeseen problems. A full <a href="http://pweb.jps.net/~cryonics/jwtechr.htm" target="_blank">technical report</a> is 
available.</b></font> 
<P><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Jerry was a strong advocate of neuro suspension and specified that choice in 
his suspension paper-work. His wishes were followed. Mr. White, with help from 
Jim Yount, and a local pathologist and morticians, suspended the brain of 
Jerry's mother Susan, in 1992. Later that year, Jerry and Jim, with the 
assistance of a veterinarian, suspended the family cat, who is also a neuro.</b></font>

week under the auspices of CryoSpan with long-term storage in southern 
California.</b></font>

Am, 26790 Arastradero Rd., Los Altos Hills, CA.</b></font><P><a href="http://pweb.jps.net/~cryonics/jwphotos.htm" target="_blank"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>More Photos of Jerry</b></font></a><P><a href="cryonicspage4.htm" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/backhoekje.gif" width="39" height="31"></a>
