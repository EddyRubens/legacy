    is one of those few people who truly understand me. From the first
    moment I looked in his eyes I could see his warmth and passion. They
    seemed to watch straight through me, right into my heart.&nbsp;There was

    felt the same for me. He wanted to melt our minds together, to possess
    me totally. It frightened me and made me the happiest girl on earth at
    the same time. I guess I was never so confused before. There simply
    was no possible way to handle these immense powers. I had to go
    further or drown in oblivion. That</b></span></font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="3"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><b>’s why I left him, afraid of losing
