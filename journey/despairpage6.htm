      cherish the day Jóannis gave me the ice bear. We were sitting at the
      coastline to rest a bit, after walking for at least two hours. I was
      pulling out grass straws around me. I think I even tried to whistle
      between two blades, when he searched his pockets. <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">“</span>I’ve got something
