          was no Stig Nielsen on board of this vessel. But I did meet a Dutch
          guy called Jaco. He grew up in the same village as I did! His best friend
    turned out to be the
          son of my parent's neighbours. What a coincidence!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;
          </span>I talked with Jaco about our place of birth, the local schools
    we attended and about all the other places and people we remembered. It felt so strange. There I was, in the country of my dreams, talking about
    a childhood that seemed to be as far away as possible! It didn’t feel real. If
          I had talked with a Chinese farmer about my childhood in the rice
          fields, I would have believed that to be true as well. But it didn’t
          frighten me. On the contrary. This non-reality, this state of dreaming
    felt very close to
          euphoria.<a href="ilulissatpage2.htm" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/backhoekje.gif" align="right" width="39" height="31"></a></b></span></font>
