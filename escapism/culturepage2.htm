        are a lot of young dogs as well. Gaba has a litter. I was curious if he
        planned to keep every one of them. He couldn’t decide about the puppies yet,
        but said that two of the older dogs would die very soon. He pointed them out. They
        looked very healthy to me, so I asked for the reason. One of them was
        already two years old, he told me, and the other one was too small...&nbsp; </b></font></td>

        in Greenland just don’t feel any tenderness for animals. Especially not for
        dogs. Dogs are there for pulling the sledges and they are certainly no pets. The
        quality of the breed can save a person's life and that’s why the weakest
        ones have to
        be killed. I can understand the need for this, but it was still shocking
        to come across a dead dog. She was clearly killed with stones and her legs were
        tied. I think she was pregnant. Nature here is violent and so are
        the people. But why didn’t they remove the corps?</b></span></font><b><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="3"><a href="culturepage1.htm" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/backhoekje.gif" align="right" width="39" height="31"></a></font></b></p>
