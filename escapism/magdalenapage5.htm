      has been sowing her whole life. She learned it at the age of seven. I asked her if
      she had ever sown a national costume with colourful beads. There I touched
      another tender string! The excitement returned and she showed me several
      costumes, including the kamikken. I had already used the words “<i>kusanaq</i>”
      and “<i>kusanartoq</i>” so often that I had to find another way to
      express my admiration. Making pictures of it turned out to be a very
      good option. Magdalena was so proud of her creations that she loved it
      when I photographed them. And she confirmed that the Dutch whalers had brought the
      beads to Sisimiut, as if she had seen it herself.</b></span></font></p>
