      I wasn’t able to take pictures when the biggest mass of ice calved
      down. It was so eminently beautiful; I didn’t dare to miss a second of
      it. So
      I was nailed to the ground with the camera in my right hand and my mouth
      wide open. Of course, I could have pushed the shutter release without looking
      through the lens, but there was no time to think about that. I was totally
      caught up in the spectacle. This brick of ice was so enormous that it
      looked as if the whole glacier was collapsing. When it hit the surface
      it filled the air with water drops. I could see a clear
      rainbow for more then ten seconds. It took me at least ten minutes before
      my knees stopped shaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;<a href="endorphinspage2.htm" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/backhoekje.gif" align="right" width="39" height="31"></a></span></b></span></font>
