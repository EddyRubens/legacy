    I’m going to spend several days with a person I don’t know at all! We
    will be totally alone and entirely dependent
    upon each other. What if this man is not so friendly as he seems to be? What
    if he turns out to be very annoying and irritating? I’m getting doubts
    about my invitation. It will be my first time to walk with someone else and
    I’m not sure I’ll be good company. I know I can be very grumbly when
    I’m tired! Perhaps he’ll walk so fast I can’t keep up. Or maybe he doesn’t
    like to rest as often as I do. It might be wise to talk this over with Ulrik
    before we depart. And reserve the possibility to split up during the trip if
    one of us wants to. <o:p>
