      lovely to be taken in to this family life! I had dreamed about this, but didn’t
      dare to hope for it. The atmosphere in this house is so good that I felt
      at home within two hours' time. Magdalena showed me her family pictures. Now I
      know about all the family members. Who is married to whom, how many
      children they have and where they live. Some nieces came by to visit
      Magdalena, or where they here to watch the stranger? After dinner we all went
      all into the living room. The eldest niece played a video she taped on
      Christmas Eve. It was a Greenland choir dressed in the national
      costume singing psalms. Magdalena served little toasts with marmalade. “Mamma, mamma!”
      is what you’re supposed to say while eating. It means
      you like the taste and you give thanks to the one who takes care. I felt
      like a little duck when Magdalena nodded approvingly.
