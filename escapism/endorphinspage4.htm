      fall down if I tried to turn back. Going further was no option either,
      because there, it was getting even steeper than it already was. Going up was the only way
      to get out of this miserable situation. I was very afraid and even thought
      about dropping my backpack, because the heavy weight of it would surely
      make me drown if I would happen to fall into the water. Was it a smart idea to unbind the backpack? Or would
      this only get me out
      of balance? After taking some deep breaths I decided to trust my abilities and
      climb up calmly. I felt so relieved when I reached a safe spot! All I
      wanted now was to return to civilization as soon as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;</span></b></span></font>
