There have been four funerals this week. The first was      for a sixteen-year-old girl who committed suicide. She shot herself      through her hart with her father's hunting-rifle. Then there was another      suicide. And a homicide the day after that. The murderer tried to kill himself      afterwards, but failed. He is still in the intensive care. And there was      also a natural death. All in one week! I am glad to hear this is not      normal. This is the average for a whole year. These funerals cause a strange      atmosphere. Who will be next?</b></font>      <p><img border="0" src="images/funeral1.jpg" width="400" height="185"></p>    </td>      <counter style=mblue>  </tr></table></div></body></html>
