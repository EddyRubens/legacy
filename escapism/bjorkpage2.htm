        fascinates me from the time she was the pregnant lead singer of K.U.K.L., her
        band before the Sugarcubes. That must have been almost twelve years ago.
        These fascinations turned into a surrogate obsession in 1998, when my
        best friend ended our friendship. I had been secretly in love with this
        friend since we met, but never dared to risk the friendship by letting
        her know. Now I have lost this friendship anyway. Missing her felt so terrible! I started to see her as the most perfect woman. That became
        unbearable to live with. The thought of accidentally running into her on
        the street made me nervous. What should I say to her? I wanted to end
        this obsession as soon as possible. The solution was Björk. I projected
        this unbearable love for my best friend on a pop idol. Björk became my
        new goddess. That worked out very well. I searched for pictures and
        articles on the Internet and collected all the music involving Björk, without harming anyone. And there was no reason to worry
        about meeting her in real life.<a href="bjorkpage1.htm" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/backhoekje.gif" align="right" width="39" height="31"></a></b></font></p>
