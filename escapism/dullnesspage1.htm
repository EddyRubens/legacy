        nothing to do in Kangerlussuaq. I think I’ve met all the inhabitants
        by now. Everyone with a job works at the airport. Those who are
        unemployed hang around there as well for that matter. So do I. The chairs in the waiting
        area are the best in town and there are far too many mosquitoes outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Besides that, it’s the only place where you can buy something to drink when
        the supermarket is closed. A couple of times a day the airport is overcrowded.
        That is when an aeroplane has just arrived. Passengers are waiting for
        their next plane to leave. I watch them wait. There is nothing else to do.</span><a href="dullnesspage2.htm" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/nexthoekje.GIF" align="right" width="39" height="31"></a>
