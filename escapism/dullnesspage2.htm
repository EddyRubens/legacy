        of the women here are absolutely gorgeous. It doesn’t matter if they have
        Inuit or Danish ancestors; they all have such pretty faces! Perhaps living
        among nature makes you look like this. Or maybe it is the daily diet of fresh fish.
        Whatever their secret is, it works out differently for the Greenland men. They
        look rather funny and they behave like children. At the airport&nbsp;
        there are several television sets. The screens are suspended from the ceiling to
        provide flight information, but the men prefer to watch television. Once
        I saw two men changing the channel back and forth, because they both
        wanted to see a different programme. One of them had just turned his
        programme
        on again and went back to his seat. Before his butt touched the
        chair, the other man had already changed it back to <i> his</i> favorite
        channel.
        They didn’t get angry or irritated or anything; they just kept changing the channel
        back and forth over a hundred times! <a href="dullnesspage1.htm" target="main"> <img border="0" src="images/backhoekje.gif" align="right" width="39" height="31"></a></b></span></font></td>
