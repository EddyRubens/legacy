        been here in real life before. During these months I have created a
        detailed image of this area. And now I<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">’</span>m finally in the middle of the

        is so much warmer here than I thought it would be and all the snow has
        melted. It is summer now whereas my avatar arrived here in springtime.</b></font></p>

        travel guides write about the musk oxen. They promised me I would meet
        them.
        And indeed, I have seen such a gigantic cow! I suspect the guides of
        fooling me because this cow doesn’t look like a wild animal at all. I bet they
        put it here for the tourists. I even searched for a chain! This gives a good impression
        of how spoiled I am. Facts and fantasy
        leap into each other. Modern aeroplanes help me in this. As it happens It
        took me only a
        couple of hours to fly from Copenhagen into this fantasy world. Like the
        first level of sleep brings you to the REM, the state of dreaming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;<a href="finallypage2.htm" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/backhoekje.gif" align="right" width="39" height="31"></a></span></b></span></font></td>
