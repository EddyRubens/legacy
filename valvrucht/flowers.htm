		Hieronder een interview met Gerard van Flowers In The Dustbin, afgenomen 
		in december 2005. FITD waren een deel van de anarcho-punkscene in de 
		jaren ’80, al waren hun muziek en teksten allesbehalve cliché zoals die 
		van zovele andere groepen wel waren. Ze waren nooit een ‘grote naam’ 
		zoals Conflict, Crass, Dead Kennedys, maar zoals ze zelf zeggen&nbsp;: wij 
		waren meer bezig met direkte aktie, wat niet van alle groepen in die 
		tijd gezegd kan worden.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="FR-BE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Deze 
		site wordt in januarie grondig bijgewerkt, en dan zullen illustraties 
		aan dit interview worden toegevoegd, waaronder een interview dat ik in 
		1985 van hen afnam voor mijn toenmalige punk-fanzine ‘Lastig’.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="FR-BE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="FR-BE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Here’s 
		the answers – I’ve left out some questions as they were too open ended 
		and would require a book to answer&nbsp;!</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="FR-BE" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-I interviewed you once in 
		1985/6 for my fanzine Lastig, and indeed the questions were so simple: 
		Anarchy? Vivisection? Eating meat? Sympathy with left-wing urban 
		guerillas like RAF and CCC? You said afterwards: it was as if bands were 
		filling in these questions by writing a song about every well-known 
		issue… what anarcho-bands were an exception to the rule you would say…?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Most of the best ones I suppose 
		– Poison Girls, Rubella Ballet, The Mob, The Apostles, Zounds, Blyth 
		Power etc Anyone who didn’t use the phrase ‘the system’, perhaps. Also 
		some lesser known bands like The Committee, who were only lesser known 
		because they didn’t play up to all the clichés. Of course, the more 
		clichés you used, the bigger you became within that scene.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I was always uncomfortable with 
		lyrics that were sure they were ‘right’ about something – I always 
		instinctively felt that was dangerous and sometimes clearly insincere.
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-What was the “Vethixo” disco? 
		“Vethixo” was part of a new language you were creating, could you expand 
		a bit more ; why, what for, etc. Some words like ‘love’, ‘god’, ‘bliss’ 
		or many other words, what did they sound like in your language?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I didn’t get very far with the 
		language. To be honest I can’t remember what the idea was, but I guess 
		it was equal mixes of youthful arrogance and pretension!</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-What was the Wapping 
		anarchy-centre like, the bands, the people, the frustrations of 
		drug-abuse maybe? </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was horrible – it was the 
		first time I, or my friends, had come across fellow punks that we didn’t 
		actually like – there always seemed to be the solidarity of the outsider 
		up till that place. There were a couple of interesting bands I saw there 
		– Twelve Cubic Feet spring to mind – but generally I didn’t like it 
		there at all. I don’t understand what you mean by the frustrations of 
		drug abuse in this context, but for the record, I wasn’t taking drugs at 
		all and don’t remember seeing any at Wapping. Not that I was exactly a 
		regular. The only fond memory I have of the place is singing ‘You Made 
		Me Love You’ (an old crooner song by Judy Garland) a capella and the 
		sound man putting loads of echo on my voice – quick thinking on his 
		part! I remember Andy Martin from the Apostles enjoying that moment but 
		I don’t many people got it.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">There was another anarchy-centre 
		(Centro Iberico?), what was that like? </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">That was a bit better, but not 
		much. Nobody I knew really went to those places unless we were playing 
		(‘we’ incidentally were the Anabollic Steroids – my first band – not 
		FITD). The Centro Iberico was run by old Spanish anarchists, but they 
		were never at the gigs or anything.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Which was the one financed by 
		the Crass/Poison Girls single ‘Bloody revolutions/Persons Unknown?’</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Wapping.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-I know a lot but not 
		everything, but could you tell the readers about the ‘All The Madmen’ 
		records and ‘96 Tapes’ labels? Who ran it? What bands were on it. Am I 
		right to think a demo of Pandora’s Box was also on 96 tapes – I’d love 
		to see the ‘96’ catalogue? (And what was the name of Pandora’s Box 
		before they changed their name, under their former name, weren’t they on 
		a well-sold compilation album (Bullshit Detector 2?)?) </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">At the times we had contact with 
		them, All The Madmen was run by Alistair Livingstone from the Puppy 
		Collective / Black sheep housing co-op. Who was, and is, a genius now 
		writing a blog called Green Galloway. 96 Tapes was run by Rob Challice</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Who went on to work in the music 
		bizness. I don’t remember Pandora’s Box.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-What other bands in the first 
		half of the eighties were musically different from the rest, I’m 
		thinking of The Suspect’s singer (Dave Asgrove???), Null&amp;Void, Blyth 
		Power, Pandora’s Box, Chumabawankas (sic?) of course, name and describe 
		a few others please?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Loads – my favourite band was 
		Dexy’s Midnight Runners – a great British soul band. I loved all sorts 
		of music, as long as it had a heart and / or a brain – in other words, a 
		soul. At the time, I was also listening to the 60s singer Melanie Safka 
		a lot too. And Adam And The Ants were spectacular in the short period 
		between donning the red Indian look and deciding to go for children as a 
		target market.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Southern Death Cult were great 
		for a while too, as were Bow Wow Wow. I really like Chumbawamba by the 
		way, though I wasn’t keen back then.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-Who were Great Society, </span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Grace Slicks first band before 
		Jefferson Airplane</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Monochrome Set, </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Stylish post-punk band featuring 
		Andy Warren from Adam &amp; The Ants. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sex Gang Children, </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">They were around at the same 
		time as Southern Death Cult but were more quirky and less ‘rock’.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Rauschenberg, </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Robert Rauschenberg was an 
		American Pop Artist</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ornette Coleman? </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">An American saxophonist – free 
		jazz etc</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-You also mention Modern 
		English: I think their first album (‘Mesh and Lake’???) was superb but 
		it got watered down later. What other records between ’77 and ’84&nbsp; by 
		bands like Bauhaus and Southern Dead Cult were and are still in your 
		collection? </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">None by bands like that (since I 
		moved over to Cds). A quick glance at my CD rack shows what I’ve 
		bothered buying again:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dirk / Kings – Adam &amp; The Ants</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Can’t Stand The Rezillos</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Crass – Best Before 1984</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Jilted John – True Love stories</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">ATV – The Image Has Cracked</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Gang Of Four – Entertainment</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The Slits – Cut</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Subway Sect compilation</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">…that’s all from the punk side 
		of things. Unless you count Dread Meets Punk Rockers Uptown, which is a 
		compilation of all the reggae they used to play at the Roxy, and Sex, 
		which is a comp of the records on the jukebox in the Kings Rd Shop.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-Did you know that the composer 
		of Nat King Cole’s ‘Nature boy’ was pre-hippy Edhen Abhez? He’s got a 
		great CD out now, released by RE/Search I think?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">No I had no idea – thanks for 
		this info! I got to Nature Boy via Nat King Cole rather than anything 
		hippy. Though obviously I must have picked up on the mystic lipstick 
		where the song was sealed with a loving kiss. Or something.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-What went wrong at the gig you 
		did with Flux and KUKL (Björk’s band on Crass recs)? Flux were quite 
		dogmatic I think whereas KUKL were not?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We (FITD) originally organized 
		it as a Stop The City benefit – we were the only band involved at this 
		point - and asked Flux to play. Then they muscled in, chucking bands 
		we’d asked to play off the bill and replacing them with their own 
		impositions, one of whom was KUKL – for a band of supposed anarchists, 
		they (Flux) sure enjoyed wielding power- the power of their popularity 
		as right-on anarchist role-models. You can imagine how we felt about 
		that. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-And tell me everything about 
		the tour with Fuzzbox? I remember they had a hit? Please tell everything 
		that went good, wrong, neutral, and especially hilaric?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This question is too big axel – 
		it would require a book to answer it! Suffice to say it was an enormous 
		mismatch but we had the time of our lives! I still have my tour diary 
		and Antje has hers – we may one day put them on the website.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-Mars Bars Tour (Mars being 
		‘attacked’ by the ALF around that time) and you think the animal 
		liberation movement was the strongest thing punk ever produced. I do 
		think so too, maybe apart from the squatters movement all over Europe.
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">No, not punk, but the anarcho 
		punk movement. I think the wider punk movement influenced all sorts of 
		things, often to do with design and aesthetics. I thought the squatting 
		movement across Europe was established before punk? But yes, I think the 
		strongest thing the anarcho-punk culture did was enliven the animal 
		liberation movement.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Contradictions are always part 
		of life, aren’t they?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I think contradictions are the 
		crucial difference between dogma (which produces totalitarianism) and 
		pragma (which doesn’t have to). I think contradictions are&nbsp; beautiful – 
		they create the spaces through which ideas can be explored and 
		progressive ideas emerge.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Contradictions are an integral 
		part of any life lived beyond dogma and rules, and therefore any attempt 
		at freedom.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-Drinking and smoking joints, 
		that was what you were doing, as so many other people did (I still 
		remember a somewhat rare sort of black hash I bought at school the same 
		day your 12” and Lost Cherrees LP arrived at home via mail-order. A day 
		never to forget, really. But as I see the cheeks on your pictures I 
		wonder if other drux were involved, speed maybe? Not that I care by the 
		way, and I’m probably wrong? But you do admit to drink too much 
		nowadays?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We didn’t really take any other 
		drugs on a regular basis, though we all dabbled with speed and acid. I 
		don’t drink at all these days! If you’re thinking of the lyrics on 
		‘Diary Of An Alcoholic’, those were written about 1992. The lyrics on 
		South London aren’t (as people sometimes presume) autobiographical – 
		parts of it are taken from my experiences, but then changed and messed 
		about with to make a better song. Indeed, that’s the lyric where I 
		realized not everything had to reflect my own experience 100%. Which is 
		either artistically growing up or selling out or both or neither.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-Do you still have the booklet 
		that came with “All the best…” demo? And what exactly got lost in the 
		fire of Cold Harbour recs, who released your latest single ‘Lick my…’, 
		master tape, video’s?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This won’t seem overly 
		nostalgic, but 1) no and 2) I don’t know – I think it was a Rick Astley 
		album as there was a big studio downstairs. I remember being driven mad 
		when The Christians were recording ‘Ideal World’ down there – it was all 
		I heard for about a month.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-Are you playing live again? 
		Want to release more music on CD? Reactions of public and/or labels?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We will perform live again, but 
		not in the standard gig way unless we can find some way of subverting 
		the context. I’m not sure why we should put music on CDs now we have mp3 
		culture, but never say never. I haven’t even thought about labels. The 
		public reaction has been quite astonishing in terms of downloads – 
		thousands every month. I guess this must be the internet at work!</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-I made the comparison with my 
		fave artists these days: Antony and the Johnsons? I’m not saying you 
		sound the same, but just melancholy with piano? Do you see the 
		comparison, or is my imagination running away with me?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Funny – I hadn’t heard them when 
		I got your interview but I have since and I think he’s great. I think he 
		displays a certain honest vulnerability that I can identify with and I’d 
		be flattered by any comparison.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-What would you advise or 
		readers to listen to, read, watch (paintings, sculptures,…), please 
		expand a little on your interests?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My interests these days are with 
		art, football and love. I’d advise readers to go their own way and love 
		whatever music/art they love no matter what their contempories think. 
		That’s the most important thing – if you love it and everyone else hates 
		it, still love it.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-Any last words (for now)?</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
