		<span lang="NL" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Another other bite 
		of the <b>LOST CHERREES</b><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		A:The first question is regarding your band-name, Lost Cherrees. I 
		always thought it was something without meaning. But later I met a bloke 
		from the US and he mentioned “cherree” as something with an sexual 
		undertone. Is it an expression or so“foregone innocence”. I just met a 
		certain Griselda from the US in a pub and I asked her and she said: yeah, 
		it’s when two people first have sex togethther. <br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/lost%20cherrees%201.jpg" width="288" height="216" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="6">S: It’s the fucked. The fucked.<br>
		<br>
		B: What?,…hahaha, yeah It can mean something like that but originally to 
		us it also meant just cherrees that were… lost<br>
		<br>
		A: What was the year you called youselves punk, started making music, 
		which bands and other things influenced you?<br>
		<br>
		-1981<br>
		-The Clash and the Jam, politically Crass<br>
		-We got into that, and many other bands around that time did as well<br>
		-Discharge<br>
		<br>
		A: was only in it from 1980, I thought you could fil me in regarding the 
		three first years of punk that I missed?<br>
		<br>
		-No<br>
		-I was 9 then<br>
		<br>
		A: When did your name became known in the London and the British scene?<br>
		<br>
		-1982, 1983. In 1982 we did our first gig. After very much giging we did 
		our first single.. The second single, on Mortarhate, went to a high.<br>
		<br>
		A: Your first single was on Riot/Clone records. How did you meet Dave 
		from Riot/Clone and how did he help you to produce your record?<br>
		<br>
		-I met him after a gig.<br>
		-I thouht we had send them a tape or so.<br>
		-Yeah, that’s it.<br>
		-A tape with local bands and our song was chosen from that tape to be on 
		a compilation tape because the rest of the bands were so bad. <br>
		-It was so, it’s true.<br>
		<br>
		A: How many gigs did you do in your formation in the ‘80’s?<br>
		<br>
		About 350.<br>
		<br>
		A: That’s a lot! Were you always on the dole at that time? <br>
		<br>
		Bev: No, on the contrary, we were all working, all the time. Apart from 
		one (pointing to one of the member of the band now) who’s not working 
		now.<br>
		<br>
		A: It’s hard to imagine a band like Conflict doing 800 gigs in eight 
		years?<br>
		<br>
		-You know, it costs lot of money to be in a band? I can ’t see how you 
		can be a band on the dole.<br>
		-You always loose money.<br>
		-Yeah.<br>
		-We never made any money.<br>
		<br>
		-You have to have equipment and stuff to start with anyway.<br>
		-You’re loosing money all the time.<br>
		-You cover expenses if your lucky.<br>
		<br>
		A: When you first started you Website, you said where looking for a few 
		ex-members. Have you found them (mainly three women singers who sang 
		together)?<br>
		<br>
		-Yes, and we wish we hadden’t.<br>
		-Well, one of them wanted money when we released the back-catalogue, the 
		“In the Beginning…” CD, that was Sean.<br>
		-Debby’s a good friend, she said she wanted to re-join, but than we 
		didn’t see them when we already started giging, so Debbie sang a song -on 
		our first re-union gig.<br>
		-But they didn’t take it serious.<br>
		-Gail’s a good friend too, she might be coming tonight.<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/Lost%20cherrees%202.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6">Bev: After, say, sic months rehearsing, it was kind of, well, we were 
		sort of settled, and then they wanted to rejoin… a bit late. AND WE 
		DON’T REGRET IT, Andy and I sing quite well together. We like our sound.<br>
		<br>
		Steve: See, Andy never sang on the first album, he only played the 
		guitar. Since the re-union he also sings, so we have two vocalists.<br>
		<br>
		(RUMOER… <br>
		Bev: What is “cunt” in Belgian?<br>
		A:Kut…)<br>
		<br>
		A: With so many women singing, did you get many sexist remarks?<br>
		<br>
		-Well, a bit, but relatively speaking ver little<br>
		-We had very strong women with very high mohawks who knew how to react<br>
		<br>
		A: Talking bout records; which compilations were you on?<br>
		<br>
		-“Who? What? Why? When? Where” (the near-legendary first one on 
		Mortarhate Records, A)<br>
		-“We don’t want you fucking war”<br>
		-And also later on compilations on Mortarhate: ”This the A.L.F.” and 
		“Deleted Dialogue”<br>
		<br>
		A: How did you meet Colin of Conflict and Mortarhate?<br>
		<br>
		-I supose we just met him, I can’t remember really<br>
		-We’d heard the name Conflict before, obviously, and he always treated 
		us very nice<br>
		-Sometimes he’s a bit bitter, but he’s reallya lovely bloke<br>
		<br>
		-Without him a gig like this probably hadn’t taken place (This interview 
		was done at Stig’s Gig, a memorial for Stig, singer of Icons of Filth, 
		who died during a gig some months before – and indeed, the three days of 
		gigs brought the anarcho scene together again)<br>
		-People say Colin’s hard to get hol of but he’s not at all<br>
		<br>
		A: You seem a pacifist band while Conflict is more militant, is that 
		important?<br>
		<br>
		-They are probably more militant, they sing more about riots and things…<br>
		-We don’t write that way<br>
		<br>
		Steve: But I wouldn’t turn the other cheek when attacked. It’s not that 
		we don’t confront violence.<br>
		<br>
		A: Your lyrics are not so sloganesque, that’s what I like.<br>
		<br>
		-We are all in the bands as individuals<br>
		-So being pacifist is like a band’s stance<br>
		<br>
		Bev: He’s not so pacifist at the moment (pointing at Steve) and he 
		actually never was.<br>
		<br>
		Steve: Don’t make me think of my ex-wife… (he’s in Fathers-4-Justice)
		<br>
		<br>
		(Break: PLEASE CHECK WWW.FATHERS-4-JUSTICE, or WWW.LOSTCHERREES.CO.UK – 
		ook in Nederland is Fathers-4-Justice nu actief, ze zijn Uw steun 
		waardig. Continue:)<br>
		<br>
		A: But then within the anarcho-punk scene in England there were always 
		much bands calling themselves pacifist, while on the continent a lot of 
		squatters in Germany, and Holland too, for example supported the German 
		Rote Armee Fraktion (Red Army Faction, also known as “Baader-Meinhof” 
		gang)<br>
		<br>
		Steve: If I realise what I’ve gone through the last three years… GRRR,… 
		well, within a few years time we will all have our midlife crisis.<br>
		<br>
		A: I’ve already had mine, thank you<br>
		<br>
		-We all had (Bev laughs)<br>
		<br>
		A: An improvised question, who’s had his/her midlife crisis yet?<br>
		<br>
		(10 minutes of laughter)<br>
		<br>
		Bev: Don’t get me to start<br>
		<br>
		A: Between you splitting and reforming, did you jump back in and out of 
		the scene like I did?<br>
		<br>
		-I don’t think we were in it at all really.<br>
		<br>
		A: Never went to a gig?<br>
		<br>
		-Yes, but not this kind<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/lost%20cherrees%203.gif" width="637" height="365" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="6">Andy: I went to a lot of field raves in the end 80’s, early 90’s. It was 
		the new punk then, and I went nearly ten times to the Glastonbury 
		Festival too.<br>
		<br>
		Nuts: Me and Andy played quite a lot, we’ve improved immencely since the 
		first Cherree-incarnation. We can play all sorts of music, for example 
		psychedelic.<br>
		<br>
		-Yes, these guys can play<br>
		<br>
		Bev: I supose because we got out of it, AND WE DID, we payed no 
		attention whatsoever in the punk-scene, it was quite a shock to me that 
		it was still going on. I had moved, I lived away from here (London, I 
		supose, A), so that had to do with it, I think<br>
		<br>
		A: So you thought: we’re gonna do it again.<br>
		<br>
		-Yeah, the four of us<br>
		<br>
		-We announced to sites on the Net that we were reforming and releasing a 
		new single and now we recieve about 45 e-mails a day. So it worked out 
		O.K.<br>
		<br>
		A: And is your new album almost ready?<br>
		<br>
		-We’ve got one song left to go<br>
		<br>
		A: Any special subjects<br>
		<br>
		-The gulf war, father’s rights, some of the basic stuff we believe in.<br>
		-We think it’s gonna be very good.<br>
		<br>
		A: Your song on your CD-single benefit for Fathers-4-Justice was 
		extremely good!<br>
		<br>
		-Did you like it? thank you.<br>
		<br>
		A: Since you’ve reformed did you meet a lot of old and new faces?<br>
		<br>
		Bev: The last time we played here was with the Subhumans. Dick, their 
		singer, came on stage and he said, it was nice to see the Lost Cherrees 
		again, and we were schocked.<br>
		Basically I think, we knew him from the 80’s but now we met him as a 
		completely different bloke.<br>
		<br>
		-I’m curious how people will react to our new album, that’s gonna be the 
		first time they’ll be able to hear us properly as the band we are now, 
		20 years later<br>
		<br>
		A: another question, Barry Horne (who hungerstriked himself to death in 
		prison for the cause of animal liberation) had a child, I think (None of 
		the bands singing about him actually seems to know!,A). If you have a 
		child, without slagging anyone of I cannot imagine chosing death, brave 
		as it may be for the good cause of animal rights. Can you?<br>
		<br>
		Steve: It’s an individual opinion, and if it’s so strong, you go for it.<br>
		<br>
		A: I couldn’t, I wouldn’t<br>
		<br>
		Steve: Neither could I<br>
		<br>
		A: Did any of you ever played in another band that released vinyl or 
		CD’s?<br>
		<br>
		-No, we tried<br>
		<br>
		Bev: Do you know the Gogo’s?<br>
		<br>
		A: Of course!<br>
		<br>
		Bev: I played in a band a bit like that, but none of us got very far.<br>
		Besides I got fed up with punk because why can’t I be punk and still 
		wear jeans. And the music was all the same at some time, so we got out 
		of it.<br>
		<br>
		A: Did you know Stig of Icons of Filth? As a friend, or more vaguely 
		just someone you knew?<br>
		<br>
		Bev: Did you hear that band that just played: No Choice? Well, they’re 
		from Wales like Stig and Icons of Filth and we once played with them for 
		Stigs birthday.<br>
		One of the proudest moments for me was an e-mail from him saying “I have 
		a more than healthe liking for the Lost Cherrees”.<br>
		Fucking hell, he really liked us. And we started being very friendly 
		with him.<br>
		What I remember about Stig was that he was so passionate about things.<br>
		<br>
		A: Charismatic maybe?<br>
		<br>
		-Definately<br>
		<br>
		A: He seemed really convinced, he came on stage bare-foot…<br>
		<br>
		Bev: He often didn’t move on stage: he just spat his words and sounds at 
		the people.<br>
		<br>
		Bev: He was passionate, HE COULD NOT BE MOVED<br>
