&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span lang="NL" style="font-family: Times New Roman"><br>
		Conflict is waarschijnlijk de langstbestaande en meest bekende punkband. 
		Ondanks de vele geruchten omtrent hen, staan het “kommando” nog stevig. 
		In feite: de muziek die Conflict nu brengt kan men alleen maar 
		omschrijven als: “insane”. Twee bassen, twee gitaristen, twee 
		vocalisten, en een drummer. Velen beweren dat zanger en frontman Colin 
		“onbereikbaar” is, maar deze avond in The Forum, Camden, London was 
		Colin bereid al onze vragen te beantwoorden. Het interview vond plaats 
		ter gelegenheid van 3 dagen Stig’s Gigs, een herinneringsfeest voor de 
		Stig, de zanger van Icons Of Filth die enkele maanden geleden op een 
		optreden stierf.<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/conflict%201.jpg" width="400" height="300" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6">A: How did you get into Conflict – when did it start?<br>
		<br>
		I was in another mess-about band before, called Splatterred Rockstars, 
		and we started Conflict after seeing Crass basically.<br>
		Me and John started it, it was really wierd cause it just kinda came out 
		of nothing. We were just lucky really, know what I mean?<br>
		<br>
		A: Your logo means Anarcho-nihilist, doesn’t it?<br>
		<br>
		Yeah, there’s two A’s in it standing for anarchy and autonomy, the N 
		stand for Nihilism, but you can also read CND in it (CND = Campaign for 
		Nuclear Disarmament, het grootste deel van de Britse vredesbeweging) , 
		so people can see in it what they want. We invented it so it would have 
		a striking image.<br>
		<br>
		A: I always liked the line of Amebix in their song on Bullshit Detector 
		1 on Crass records: “I am anti-anarchist/ Nihilist?/ Yeah, that’s right, 
		I am anti-nihilist.”<br>
		Where you immediately into the politics of punk or were you influenced 
		by, say, The Clash or Crass?<br>
		<br>
		Mainly The Clash, yeah, they showed me the sensible side to punk. We 
		realised they had something sensible to say. I was into the punk-spirit 
		before, but I realised, yeah, the Clash had something to say.<br>
		<br>
		A: Personally I’m not a big Sex Pistols fan, but on your site you said 
		they were one of your influences alongside Clash and Crass?<br>
		<br>
		Yeah, that was mainly because the looks and the exitement of the time.<br>
		<br>
		A: How did you meet Paco and Kevin?<br>
		<br>
		We had another drummer before Paco but he wasn’t really interested to 
		doing it, he just did it for fun basically and wanted to see Conflict 
		big. Paco was with me at school, so I took him out of school to follow 
		us. <br>
		Kevin, now dead, was our second guitarist. I’m actually doing a sort of 
		Conflict family tree thing, because a lot of our members were in other 
		good bands as well. When Kevin left (died?) we got Marshall and Ference 
		doing the guitars. And Sarah with her red hair is now with us as a 
		singer as well, so it’s growing.<br>
		<br>
		A: And do Fear of Fear still exist, They had a site in the past but I 
		never got hold of any merchandice?<br>
		<br>
		Yeah they do, they do their own thing. As you know they were supposed to 
		play here as well, but it didn’t happen.<br>
		<br>
		(After the interview Paco told me he had given up playing for Fear of 
		Fear but Sarah, John, Ferenc were still in it. Paco would only keep 
		touring with Inner Terrestrials due to health-problems)<br>
		<br>
		A: Which of your EP’s was the first, the one on Xntrix (Poison Girls 
		related) or the one on Crass Records?<br>
		<br>
		The Crass records one: “The house that man built”. Than “To a nation of 
		animal lovers” on Corpus Christi” and then the Xntrix one: “Live at the 
		centre Iberico.”<br>
		<br>
		A: There was an insert with that one, it outlined your history, but I 
		lost it, could your recapulate?<br>
		<br>
		Was there an insert, Christ, I forgot, what did it say?<br>
		<br>
		A: The only thing I remembered was that you played a lot with Flux of 
		Pink Indians?<br>
		<br>
		I’m sorry, I forgot.<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/conflict%202.jpg" width="350" height="263" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="6"><br>
		A: Personally I liked the way Crass produced all these singles for these 
		bands, but weren’t they all a little censored, maybe manipulated to a 
		certain extent. I get this from an article by Josph Porta from the Mob 
		(and Zounds, Null&amp;Void, Blyth Power), where he wasn’t allowed to drum on 
		the Zounds-single because “not good enough” and he also said he had no 
		idea where the anarchist statements on the poster came from?<br>
		<br>
		They (Crass) had a very certain way of how they wanted the covers to 
		look and that’s fair enough. <br>
		But I wouldn’t say they censored anything. As for the music they had a 
		very clear idea of how they wanted things to sound. They had a clear 
		idea of how they wanted the production to sound. At the start I liked it 
		very much.<br>
		<br>
		A: Was there a difference with Corpus Christy?<br>
		<br>
		It was just a sublabel of Crass-records really.<br>
		<br>
		Or was there less control of Crass?<br>
		<br>
		They would do things which they didn’t want to do on Crass-records. Like 
		colour covers and things like that. You couldn’t do it on Crass, but you 
		could do it on Corpus Christy.<br>
		<br>
		A: And what made you do both the Mortarhate and Fight Back Records?<br>
		<br>
		Mainly Mortarhate started as a tape label, just putting out little 
		tapes. And then we put so much stuff out on different people’s labels 
		that we learned how simple it was, just by doing it. We had learned how 
		easy the process was. <br>
		<br>
		A: And in what year did you get really famous, in the scene in London, 
		and Britain, when you became bigger than, say, the other bands on Crass 
		records?<br>
		<br>
		That must have been round 1986 really. With the “Ungovernable Force’ 
		album, that’s when it really went up.<br>
		<br>
		A: And how was the scene than? Because I only got intereseted in it in 
		1980 and you were the first English band I ever saw.<br>
		<br>
		It was strong, it was strong. I like the way it is now as well, with 
		young and old faces together. But really the eighties were really good.<br>
		<br>
		A: And what about all these clichés like glue-sniffing and so forth?<br>
		<br>
		Most of that type didn’t come to see Conflict anymore by then because we 
		weren’t doing any squat gigs anymore and moved to bigger halls. <br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/conflict%203.jpg" width="370" height="278" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6">A: Did you feel at that time, or any other time, that you had a 
		“mission” with Conflict?<br>
		<br>
		At that time, our main battle to be honest with you was with the police 
		really. We had so much stick from them, we spend so much time, and they 
		too, to counteract each other so there was nothing much we could 
		achieve. We tried putting on gigs but were constantly harrassed.<br>
		<br>
		A: They we’re really following you?<br>
		<br>
		Yeah, all the time, stopping cars, giving little warning and so forth 
		stuffed under your throat.<br>
		<br>
		A: And were you officially banned from the UK?<br>
		<br>
		We were served a paper, which was completely blank, and it had just to 
		be filled in, but it never was properly served. (Ik vergat de naam van 
		zulk formulier, AvV).<br>
		<br>
		A: Did many agressive skinheads come to your gigs, and what was that 
		story about your heavily wounded eye about?<br>
		<br>
		Well, it first got damaged at a fight at a party, and afterwards the 
		same eye was heavily hit again by skinheads, it was quite bad, but 
		luckly it healed.<br>
		<br>
		A: I’m personally intrigued about the lyrics of your song ‘Climbing the 
		stairs’which deals with you being brutally attacked and nearly dead. The 
		lyrics at the end go:<br>
		“Back alone in the shadow of a dead man,<br>
		I’m not alone, I’m reaching for the stair rails; instead I grab the hand 
		of the father, <br>
		I see a face; it’s the face of my mother, <br>
		There’s someone else; it’s the mother of my mother<br>
		Whose strong man is helping me?<br>
		Climb up the stairs of the misery<br>
		Climb and climb the stairs from the mystery<br>
		Climbing the stairs for the unaware to see?”<br>
		<br>
		Oh yeah, the ending about the grandfather and stuff. When I was young my 
		granddad always took care of me and since he died, I’ve always had the 
		feeling he was there for me, and he protected me and I was luckily never 
		seriously harmed in a lot of bad incidents. That’s about it, in a 
		nutshell.<br>
		<br>
		A: What do you think of so many punks starting to eat meat again? Even 
		people from Anti-sect, who produced such fine lyrics against animal 
		abuse and the meat-industry.<br>
		<br>
		It’s a shame really, but we’re not: “oh, we don’t wanna know you cos you 
		eat meat”. They have to decide for themselves, there’s nothing we can do 
		about it.<br>
		<br>
		A: But aren’t you surprised, like I am?<br>
		<br>
		Oh, definately I am surprised.<br>
		<br>
		A: Paco, your drummer, always ate meat, was that because a decease, a 
		food-allergy?<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/conflict%204.jpg" width="330" height="248" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="6"><br>
		It’s true that he’s allergic to too many vegetables, but he’s Spanish, 
		you know, and he choses to eat meat. He’s upstairs if you wanna chat 
		with him.<br>
		<br>
		A: Since Paco has serious health problems – cellulites – which one of 
		the two drummers is gonna drum for Conflict in the future?<br>
		<br>
		On recordings it’s gonna be both, but live it’s gonna be Nathan now. 
		Because Paco can’t do the aircrafts anymore. A lot of the time we fly 
		now, because it got so cheap and Paco’s not up to it anymore. His leg 
		got so bad with that decease that we’re seriously worried about him. But 
		he’s gonna keep playing for Inner Terrestrials, as long as they don’t go 
		to big and he can do that.<br>
		<br>
		A: I’m glad you’re so open to people as Joe Strummer (Clash, RIP) and 
		that Justin of New Model Army despite the fact they signed to major 
		labels, but there’s one band I can’t stand and that’s Chumbawamba. It’s 
		not just that they signed to a major, but they still produce very long 
		communiques with a rotten smell of old-fashioned communism – they’re 
		playing it both ways?<br>
		<br>
		There are more people who can’t stand them. But I just recently heared 
		they did advertisement for a big American car-group, called BMW, and 
		then donated the money they owed to protesters who were squatting BMW 
		land, to preserve that part of nature. It surprired me when they signed 
		to a major but I think their hearts are still in the right place, you 
		know what I mean?<br>
		<br>
		A: What are your hobbies or passions outside of Conflict?<br>
		<br>
		I like to swim a lot. I really like that. Not much else outside of 
		Conflict, I haven’t got the time.<br>
		<br>
		A: Because many people think you are very healthy.<br>
		<br>
		Yeah? I dunno (laughs).<br>
		<br>
		A: You clearly give that expression. And art or books so?<br>
		<br>
		No, I don’t have time for that, I’m always so busy with Conflict.<br>
		<br>
		A: And in the nineties, when Conflict didn’t do much recording or 
		gigging?<br>
		<br>
		I went to clubs mainly and got into dance music, and I was also into 
		open field parties. I loved that. Basically it was just hundreds of 
		people going to a field and start raving.<br>
		<br>
		A: On your CD-single ‘Carlo Giuliani’ you sing “This message commits 
		those silent, to rise up, this time with violence ?”, and then ”Make 
		sure the more they kill, the stronger our will.”. You put a question 
		mark in after the word “violence” but I couldn’t hear it. Was that 
		intentional? What is your take on it?<br>
		<br>
		I put a question mark in, yeah, but we did that before with songs like 
		“This is the A.L.F.”. If you put a question mark in, it’s not actually 
		saying “DO IT!”, know what I mean.<br>
		<br>
		A: So people can make from it what they like?<br>
		<br>
		They can make their own assumption, yeah.<br>
		<br>
		A: I didn’t buy your last CD because I already had the two CD-singles 
		before, and I also saw your set yesterday, but the song “An option” is 
		one a lot of people don’t like and I was wondering, would you, like The 
		Xpozez once did, when dropping their song “Cocksucker” because their 
		public took it be sexist, would you compromise and maybe stop playing 
		it?<br>
		<br>
		To me the song is written in a fashion that it’s not meant like a full 
		out attack or something, there’s many ways you can look at that song and 
		the way it develops. But I don’t like safety sometimes and I don’t write 
		just that what people wanna hear and a lot of the scene, mainly in 
		London is so politically correct that you can’t say anything, and that 
		was probabably the reason for me to write it that way. But (laughter) I 
		think the words were a bit strong, yeah.<br>
		<br>
		A: Maybe that’s not bad. And what happened to your toe and wrist on your 
		American tour?<br>
		<br>
		I broke both on the stage in Los Angeles, when I fell and later let the 
		microphone-standard drop on my feet, so that was a bit of a piss off.<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/conflict5.jpg" width="225" height="172" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6">A: I feel that after starting your former website and the release of 
		‘There must be another way’ another or a newer Conflict had appeared, 
		and I like it very much. Now it’s five years on. Happy?<br>
		<br>
		Yes. We’re feeling fresh again. Conflict is feeling fresh again. 
		Certainly we’re very satisfied with the new album “There is no power 
		without control”. And also the sound we’re making is a bit better.<br>
		<br>
		A:This was basically it. Last questions: which are your short term and 
		long term plans, and what do you think is the biggest achievement 
		Conflict could ever make?<br>
		<br>
		Cor… I don’t know really. The mid-term plan is we’re working on another 
		album now. And to play as many places where we still can. I suppose 
		there’s gonna come a time when we’re gonna try some different things, do 
		some different festivals, you know what I mean. Without compromise 
		really. But with Conflict we always had to take things bit by bit 
		because you never know what’s round the corner with this band (laughs).<br>
		<br>
		O yeah, in which two books were you mentioned as a “gang”?<br>
		<br>
		One said that we weren’t in the underground really but that we were 
		really uncontrolable, and mentioned our relation with the ALF and so on. 
		The other one mentioned football etc. and said said we were thugs 
		basically and very into violence. (laughs even louder).<br>
		<br>
		O.K. that was it. <br>
