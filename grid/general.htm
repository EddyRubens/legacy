              Braintec is a progressive technology company located in 
              Portland, Oregon. For more than 12 years, we have excelled at scientific research programs investigating the possibilities to copy and store human memories. 
              Our continuous involvement in designing and testing new surgical implants and techniques has become a way of life... a total company commitment in finding new ways 
              to comprehend human thought.  For more information about the Braintec Institute, please visit our company website at: </font>

              Braintec's latest project is called Humanupload. A humanupload 
				(occasionally referred to as humandownload) is the transfer of 
				the human thought and memory from the scanned brain tissue to an 
				automated facsimile. Traditional methods in memory-science 
				generally work on a &quot;one memory in one experiment&quot; basis, which 
				means that the throughput is very limited and the &quot;whole 
				picture&quot; of human thought is hard to obtain. Through years 
				of practice, experimentation and programming Braintec has discovered a 
				combination of mental and computer techniques that permit a 
				dreamlike trance in which the computer can store all 
				MEME-activities and creates 
				<img border="0" src="images/scan.png" width="130" height="98" align="left" vspace="6" hspace="5">a humanupload. Our technology promises to monitor the whole 
				human thought at once, so that researchers can have a better 
				picture of the interactions among thousands of MEMES simultaneously.
				A humanupload can be stored on magnetic 
				tape. If the original mind gets fatally clobbered, the 
				information on the tape can be uploaded again, resulting in 
				another you, minus the experience since the copy. With enough 
				copies, you could go back to every stage in your life you prefer 
				to be. It can be a comfort in danger to have a backup copy of 
				your thoughts and memories made recently. Because of the 
				divergence the copy contains not you as you are now, but you as 
				you were at the moment of recording: a slightly different. But 
				still, most of you would be saved in cases of trauma, mental 
				illness, brain diseases or memory loss, and the misfortune would 
				be nowhere near as great as without the backup. Conservation of 
				this instantaneous exposure might come in hand for new kinds of 
				therapy as well.</font></p>

				It would take a monstrous supercomputer to analyze the millions 
				of MEMES that form a humanupload. Braintec can never afford to 
				build or buy a computer that size. To gather enough computing 
				power we created the BraintecGrid; a global grid that connects 
				thousands of volunteers� personal computers. A large pool of PC 
              users world-wide, willing to put their computers' calculating power in the 
              service of science. These computers use only a fraction of 
				their computing power. The BraintecGrid saves and distributes 
				this otherwise wasted power for our valuable scientific and 
				medical research without disturbing the usual computer use of 
				the volunteers.</font></p>

				Braintec can recycle your PC's unused 
              resources to analyze the first humanupload. We invite you to download our 
				free software � a small program called the HumanUpload Program � and 
              become part of the BraintecGrid. The HumanUpload Program works as 
              a special kind of screensaver. Like other screensavers it starts 
              up when you leave your computer unattended, and it shuts down as 
              soon as you return to work. What it does in the interim is unique. 
              While you are getting coffee, having lunch or are asleep, your 
              computer helps unraveling the memories and 
              thoughts of testsubjects. Together, we are making 
              a difference!</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> </font> </p>
