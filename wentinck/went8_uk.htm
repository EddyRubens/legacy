    van Klaveren held on to at the zoo. The fake leather bag was found on saturday, November
    14th in a ruinous building at the Mathenesserdijk by two playing children. Research of the
    fingerprints indicate that the bag must have been in her possession. The fingerprints on
    the bag match the fingerprints that have been found at her home. </strong></big></p>

    <td><big>There was a stethoscope in the bag. It is a black lightweight stethoscope with a
    double head of the brand Tycos. We're puzzled again. Why do we find a stethoscope in this
    bag and how did Rosanne get hold of it? Maybe she robbed a physisian. Such an offence has
    not been reported to the Rotterdam police, we will place an inquiry with other police
    offices this week. Pictures of the bag and the stethoscope together with a letter will be
    send to the association of physisians. Hopefully this wil shed some light on this case.</big><p align="center"><img src="images/went8_3.jpg" alt="wpe16.jpg (7081 bytes)" WIDTH="234" HEIGHT="315"><img src="images/went8_4.jpg" alt="wpe17.jpg (9416 bytes)" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="315"></p>
    <p><big>Michael E. told us, that Rosanne has already mailed him about this stethoscope. He
    proposed to her to carefully look in her bag for clues. Michael E. also suggested her to
    do normal things. This is her reply to him:</big></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><em><big>Mr,</big></em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em><big>It's very nice, the way you want to help!</big></em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em><big>Unfortunately, I have lost my bag somewhere. Besides that it was an<br>
    excellent idea of yours, to look into it for clues! Because now I can<br>
    remember one of the things that had been in the bag: some round metal plate<br>
    with two plastic strings coming out of it. What it is or what you can do<br>
    with it isn't so easy to understand. I still feel so dizzy...</big></em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em><big>Doing normal things; perhaps some walking in the rain? At least it
    feels<br>
    very good that I'm not the only person who loves the autumn.</big></em></strong></p>
