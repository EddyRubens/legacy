    <td width="729"></font>&nbsp;<strong><font size="4"><p>Hoping to gather more information about
    Rosanne van Klaveren, we contacted Jeaninne T. a second time. Jeaninne is a friend of
    Rosanne, and lives in Arnhem, Holland. The two women visited each other every week, in a
    period that seems long a go to Jeannine. </p>
    <p>On the 10th of April Rosanne added a message to the answering machine of Jeaninne. This
    was also the last time that Jeannine -and many others- heard of Rosanne.</font> <font size="2"></p>
    <p></font><a href="images/antwoordapparaat.wav"><em><font size="4">Link to answering
    machine</font></em></a><font size="2"></p>
    <p></font></strong><font size="4">Following is an excerpt of the interview with Jeaninne,
    this was all the information Jeaninne could provide. </font><font size="2"><ul>
      <li><font size="4">Did you hear from Rosanne since?</font> </li>
      <li><em><font size="4">No, I'm afraid not.</font></em> </li>
      <li><font size="4">Did you see the picture from the Zoo?</font> </li>
      <li><em><font size="4">Yes! I saw it on your website on the internet! Rosanne held on to an
        ominous looking bag. Is that the picture you're refering at?</font></em> </li>
      <li></font><font size="4">Indeed, that's the picture. Did you see the bag before?</font><font size="2"> </li>
      <li></font><font size="4"><em>Never. The bag suprises me, because it isn't her style. I
        don't like the ugly bag either.</em></font><font size="2"> </li>
      <li></font><font size="4">Do you have any idea why Rosanne might visit a zoo?</font><font size="2"> </li>
      <li></font><em><font size="4">No, absolutely not. That's why the message suprised me.
        Ofcourse, I am glad to see that's she's still alive! The only thing I can imagine, or that
        I can think of, are elephants. It struck me at the time, that every time that it was her
        turn to zap, she always kept looking at nature documentaries about elephants. I never
        understood why, maybe she likes elephants a lot. </font></em><font size="2"></li>
      <li></font><font size="4">Her turn to zap?</font><font size="2"> </li>
      <li></font><em><font size="4">Yes, once a week we watched television, mostly on fridays.
        Every other week she came to me, the other week I went to her place. We took turns to hold
        the remote. But I don't know why she liked watching elephants, I think they're clumsy
        animals. </font></em><font size="2"></li>
      <li></font><font size="4">Were those the only moments you two saw each other?</font><font size="2"> </li>
      <li></font><em><font size="4">Yes, we didn't have time to see each other more often.</font></em><font size="2"> <strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p></font><font size="4">Well then, elephants. I don't think we're getting anywhere with
    this information. I presume Rosanne didn't visit the zoo with a bag full of elephant food.</font></strong></td>
