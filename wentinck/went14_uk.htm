    picture. In the accompanied letter she wrote that she has been following our search for
    Rosanne van Klaveren for several months already. That's why the man's tie struck her. The
    resemblance of the pattern to that of the gents slip found by inspector P. van Veen inside
    Rosanne's washing machine, is striking indeed! The only difference is the number of
    specks. Instead of the four specks inside the panes of the gents slip, we count only one
    on the tie. </big></td>

    last but one book, <strong><em>American Psycho</em></strong>, is full of horrible passages
    in which the main character Patrick Bateman tortures and murders people. Reactions to this
    book were very divergent. Maybe that is the reason why it took Ellis eight years to get
    his last book published. This book is called <strong><em>Glamorama</em></strong> and its
    events take place in the international fashion society. The main character gets offered a
    huge amount to search for a model missing in Londen. </big></td>

    three black suits and twenty white throusers, he must have only few ties as well. We
    wonder if this writer of atrocities has the same taste as the owner of the slip that has
    been found.</big><p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="5" color="#0000FF">Wentinck@hotmail.com</font></strong></td>
