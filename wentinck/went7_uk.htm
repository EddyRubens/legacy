    <td>&nbsp;<p><big>Two days ago, we received an email from Michael E. from the U.S.A. This man
    wrote to us, that he and Rosanne are emailing each other since ten days. On Wednesday,
    November 4th, Rosanne mailed him with a request for help. She wrote: <strong><em><font
    color="#0000FF">PLEASE, HELP ME FIND MYSELF!</font> </em></strong></big></p>
    <p><big>For us, this is decisive news. It has been talked about several times, to stop our
    search for Rosanne. It seemed that Rosanne didn't want to be found, a lot of readers
    shared this assumption. Presure from the family and our involvement with her sons made us
    decide not to stop the investigations. Now that Rosanne asks for help herself, there's no
    doubt anymore: the search wil continue.&nbsp; </big></p>
    <p><big>The mail that's been send to us:</big></p>
    <p><strong><big><em>To whom it may concern,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></big></strong></p>
    <p><strong><big><em>It seems I have a new email pal.&nbsp; Although it seems difficult to
    understand the full nature of your search, I want you to know that she is out here on the
    Internet, searching.&nbsp; We have sent messages back and forth for a week or so. What
    Rosanne is searching for remains a subject of debate, so I need not speculate. Obviously,
    I have no idea where she is.&nbsp; I guess that is all I have to say at this point. I
    would appreciate some information concerning who you are from you and not your website
    (because, realistically, you could be anyone with a computer, in fact, this whole thing
    might be someone having some fun at the expense of the masses.&nbsp; But I shall take
    Rosanne at her word, that she is the person you are searching for.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></big></strong></p>
    <p><strong><big><em>Kindly regards,&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael E.</em></big></strong></p>
    <p><big>We hope to keep contact with Michael E., because we would like to know what
    Rosanne has told about herself and her disappearance. But above all we shall of course try
    to give her the help she's asking for, off course. If you or someone you know did also
    receive a mail from Rosanne, please let us know. You can contact us</big></p>
