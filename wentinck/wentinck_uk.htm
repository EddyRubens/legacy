    <td><big>Rosanne van Klaveren is a single mother of two sons, Samuel (4) and Robin (6).
    That Friday afternoon she brought her children to their grandparents in Boskoop, to stay
    for the weekend. Sunday afternoon her parents discovered that she was not home, as they
    were bringing the boys back to their mother.</big><p><big>There were no traces of any
    violence in her flat and the immediate vicinity. On the other hand, there were no traces
    of an intended departure either. There was a large amount of wet linnen in the washing
    machine, which was already smelling fouly. The milk and fresh vegetables indicated that
    she intended to stay home for the weekend.</big></p>
    <p><big>The family members are puzzled and very worried. They think Rosanne van Klaveren
    has not disappeared out of her own free will. They fear she has been kidnapped or she has
    been the victim of a terrible accident. Mother Wilma van Klaveren:</big> <big><b><i>&quot;I
    had the feeling that something wasn&#146;t right. Rosanne usually calls to see if the boys
    are alright. She didn&#146;t call this weekend, which got me worrying. When we were in
    Zevenaar to bring back the boys and she didn&#146;t answer the door I got really scared.
    Did she have an accident, was she lying unconscious in her flat ? Those things do happen
    you know. We could open the door with the spare key from the housing corporation, but she
    was not home.&quot;</i></b></big></p>
    <p><big>She had an appointment with her friend Jeaninne T. on Saturday, for their weekly
    evening watching television. Rosanne canceled the evening appointment with a message in
    the answering machine on Friday. This message is the last that has been heard of her:</big>
    <big><a href="images/antwoordapparaat.wav">&quot;Uuhm, hè Rosanne here, I can&#146;t come
    tomorrow evening, to bad huh? Yes, humm. Well, you know, you&#146;ll be hearing from me,
    alright? Bye.&quot;</a></big></td>
