    Rosanne van Klaveren:</em></strong></big></p>
    <p><big><strong><em>Because of the notice on your site, I'd like to tell you this: on the
    first of January this year, about four o'clock pm, the frontdoor of the Avatar Grand Hotel
    opened and someone came in. It was a tousled looking woman dressed in a long coat. (This
    is what I heared later from some witnesses - I haven't seen her myself that day.) First
    she went inside the dancepalace end ordered something to drink. Our barkeeper could not
    remember what she ordered was, although she was the only customer at that moment. But he
    knows for sure it was an alcoholic beverage. He was that day, because the day before was
    New Years Eve, even more silent then usually. She didn't say anything either. She emptied
    her glass in a quiet dark corner, after that she left the dancepalace. Then the towelgirl
    saw her going into the lobby, where she took the key from room 1 and opened the door of
    our post room with it. (Things like that are quite normal in our hotel, so she didn't pay
    much attention.) At that moment I was inside my own apartment, so I haven't noticed her
    appearances. It seems that she has asked for me inside the post room, but when she heared
    that I wasn't attainable at that moment, she deposited a letter and left the message that
    she would come back later to meet me. The letter she left made me suspect that this woman
    must have been Rosanne van Klaveren herself. You must know, I wrote her several times and
    in the last letter she said she wanted to meet me. I placed her letter in our post room
    collection, so you can read it if you want. LETTER NUMBER 9. Today it is January the 3rd
    1999. I suppose Rosanne wil return to the hotel to meet me, or to bring other letters, but
    I'm not sure. I will wait. I hope you can use this information. The letter from Rosanne
    can be read inside our post room,(key no.1).</em></strong></big></p>
