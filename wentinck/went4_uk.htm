    Rotterdam. Although bodily remains were never found, it was feared that Rosanne died an
    unnatural death.</strong></font></p>

    that day. Near the entrance her family was photographed by the zoo's professional
    photographer, a service provided to every interested visitor. Before leaving the zoo, Mrs.
    De Vries bought the picture. A female passer-by can be seen in the background. This person
    has been identified as Rosanne van Klaveren beyond any doubt.</big><p><big>&nbsp;</big></td>

    <p align="left"><big>The photograph makes clear that Rosanne is alive but leaves us with a
    lot of questions. Did Rosanne talk to anyone around 15.30 p.m. - the time the photo was
    taken? And if so, to whom, and what about? We can see that Rosanne klings tightly to a
    fake leather bag and looks rather distressed, or so it seems. What could be the contents
    of the bag? We can only guess at her motives for visiting this zoo. </big></p>
    <p align="left"><big>If you have any information, be it about her presence at
    &quot;Diergaarde Blijdorp&quot;on thursday september 17th, be it about the possible
    contents of the bag, please let us know. Other hints, suggestions and motives that
    possibly led to her disapperance are more than welcome. We want to thank you for your
    attention.</big></td>
