    his story:</big></strong></p>
    <p><big>Tuesday, November 17th, at noon there was a stange woman in our café. We agreed
    this was noteworthy. She probably is the woman you're after.</big></p>
    <p><big>She attracted the attention of the whole café by making weird noises. The almost
    inhuman gurgling throat sounds resembling the moaning of a cat in heat, made a few
    customers leave early. Because I got curious, I monitored her surf-operations from our
    main computer. At first she only visited chatrooms and messageboards, where she left the
    text<strong><em> '<font color="#FF0000">PLEASE, HELP ME FIND MYSELF</em></strong>!</font>'</big>.</td>

    had to interrupt the phonecall because the woman laughed loud and indecently. She yelled
    so hard that for a moment I thought the windows would crack. While everyone was holding
    their fingers in their ears, the woman left our café screaming.&nbsp; On the PC she was
    working on I found this avi-file.</big><br>
