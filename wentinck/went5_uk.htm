    <td><i>Rotterdam, October 14th, 1998<p>Dear people of the detective agency Wentinck,</p>
    <p>In september I have been to the zoo with my children. That's where this picture has
    been made. There's a woman on it I find rather suspicious. Every time I take a look at the
    picture, my attention goes out to that woman with her bag.</p>
    <p>When I read your story with al those pictures on the Internet, I took the picture from
    the zoo. That women, irritatingly present on the picture, looks very much like the women
    you are looking for. That's why I send you my picture, I hope you can use it.</p>
    <p>The zoo is called Diergaarde Blijdorp and we have been there on thursday 17th of
    september. You can always call me if you wish.</p>
    <p>My number is: (censored because of privacy).</p>
    <p>Kind regards, Mrs. J.H. de Vries. </i></td>
