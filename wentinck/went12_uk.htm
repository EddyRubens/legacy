    <td>&nbsp;<p align="left"><big>We are back from our visit to the Faroe islands last week. The
    research we've done over there, makes us think that Rosanne van Klaveren is no longer
    hiding on one of this isles since September. Before that time she has been signalled
    several times. We spoke with Ms. E. Jákupsen, owner of the small fisherman's store in
    Leirvík where Rosanne bought groceries several times: </big></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><em><big>&quot;Rosanne is a frightened woman that is easily
    scared. Sometimes she seemed to see or hear things. She then looked up to see if no one
    was looking. I got nervous in her presence.&quot;</big></em></strong></p>

    <td><big>J. Jorgensen, the local pastor, knew kende Rosanne:</big><p><strong><em><big>&quot;We
    have a small pier where I love to fish. The view over the fjord is really beautiful!
    Rosanne used to sit there, so we had the chance to talk to each other a few times. She was
    always happy and in a good mood. She talked about Jóannis Kristiansen al the time, what
    great man he was and so on. She always talked about him in the present tense. Jóannis is
    being seen by most islanders as the best Faroe artist ever, but the praise for him by
    Rosanne beat everything. When I pointed out to her that the artist had been dead since a
    long time, she reacted very indignated. She denied it and assured me that Jóannis took
    good care of her. I felt sorry for her, reality and fiction were probalbly difficult to
    tell apart.&quot;</big></em></strong></p>
    <p><big>Will Rosanne fall in love with a dead man? Have her fantasies got that much out of
    hand, that she wrote us the letter in the name of Jóannis? For the time being, we stick
    to that.</big></td>
